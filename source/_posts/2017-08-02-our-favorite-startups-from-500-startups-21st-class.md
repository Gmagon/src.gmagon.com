## Our favorite startups from 500 startups’ 21st class

Posted10 minutes agobyJohn Mannes

Another season, another group of startups presenting as part of 500 Startups’ 21st demo day. This time around, 29 companies pitched on stage at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. We noticed strong trends in healthcare focused businesses as well as startups tackling international markets out of the gate.

Perhaps the most interesting trait of the startups selected for our top eight was geographic breath. Despite only including a handful of startups, we managed to include teams based in Baltimore, San Diego, London and Philadelphia. Check out the full list for more information on young companies looking to capitalize on the continuing rise of short term rentals, the increase of startups dealing with medical records and the growing ubiquity of conversational commerce.

### Chatter Research

### Vacayo

[Vacayo](http://www.vacayo.com/)offers property management to homeowners with extra space on their hands. The startup will pay above market rates, furnish and take on the burden of finding tenants.

The startup has all the normal frills one would come to expect from short-term property management startups like dynamic pricing and guest support staff. Contracts with owners are long-term, but the short-term leasing flexability allows Vacayo to pull in more monthly revenue than traditional property managers.

### So-Sure

Building off the behavioral momentum of Lemonade,[So-Sure](https://wearesosure.com/?site=uk)is adding extra incentives to the mix to keep those with homeowners insurance from committing fraud. Users have the potential to be reimbursed when they opt to be insured in a self-selected pool of friends.

Ideally, if nobody claims, money gets funneled back. The company started with phone insurance in the UK testing a similar model.

### MedStack

By using MedStack, teams can shave-off substantial time from development and begin sales sooner with less uncertainty and regulatory risk.

### FactoryFour

[FactoryFour](https://www.factoryfour.com/)is a complete platform for manufacturing process management. The platform takes advantage of the mass quantities of data being generated by machines today to improve operational efficiency and help ensure compliance.
