hy use logic and your hands to solve a Rubik’s Cube, when you could 3D print your own Rubik’s Cube Solver and thus avoid overexerting your fingers and brain cells? Here to help you with this is[Otvinta](http://www.otvinta.com/index.html)‘s new robotic make:

This 3D-printed Raspberry PI-powered Rubik’s Cube solving robot has everything any serious robot does — arms, servos, gears, vision, artificial intelligence and a task to complete. If you want to introduce robotics to your kids or your students, this is the perfect machine for it. This robot is fully 3D-printable.

## Rubik’s Cubes

[As Liz has said before](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/cube-solver/), we have a lot of Rubik’s cubes here at Pi Towers. In fact, let me just…hold on…I’ll be right back.

…

Okay, these are all the ones I found on Gordon’s desk, and I’m 99% sure there are more in his drawers.

And that’s just Gordon. Given that there’s a multitude of other Pi Towers staff members who are also obsessed with the little twisty cube of wonder, you could use what you find in our office to restock an entire toy shop for the pre-Christmas rush!

So yeah, we like Rubik’s Cubes.

## The 3D-Printable Rubik’s Cube Solver

Aside from the obvious electronic elements, Otvinta’s Rubik’s Cube Solving Robot is completely 3D-printable. While it may take a whopping 70 hours of print time and a whole spool of filament to make your solving robot a reality, we’ve seen[far more time-consuming prints with a lot less purpose than this](https://3dprint.com/12933/3d-printed-castle-complete/).

\(If you’ve clicked the link above, I’d just like to point out that, while that build might be 3D printing overkill, I want one anyway.\)

After 3D printing all the necessary parts of your Rubik’s Cube Solving Robot, you’ll need to run the Windows 10 IoT Core on your Raspberry Pi. Once connected to your network, you can select the Pi from the IoT Dashboard on your main PC and install the RubiksCubeRobot app.

Then simply configure the robot via the app, and you’re good to go!

You might not necessarily need a Raspberry Pi to create this build, since you could simply run the app on your main PC. However, using a Pi will make your project more manageable and less bulky.

You can find all the details of how to make your own Rubik’s Cube Solving Robot on[Otvinta’s website](http://www.otvinta.com/download12.html), so do make sure to head over there if you want to learn more.

## All the robots!

This isn’t the first Raspberry Pi-powered Rubik’s Cube out there, and it surely won’t be the last. There’s[this one](https://www.geek.com/tech/raspberry-pi-plus-lego-equals-robot-that-solves-rubiks-cube-in-90-seconds-1687194/)by Francesco Georg using LEGO Mindstorms;[this one](https://www.slashgear.com/raspberry-pi-lego-solve-a-rubiks-cube-together-31473381/)was originally shared on Reddit; Liz wrote aboutthis one; and there’s one more which I can’t seem to find but I swear exists, and it looks like the Eye of Sauron! Ten House Points to whoever shares it with me in the comments below.
