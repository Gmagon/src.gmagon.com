## What is FLAC?
FLAC is short for Free Lossless Audio Codec, it is a musical encoding format that maintains the same quality as the original source despite often being less than 50 percent of the original file size. 

The files are free and distributed to users under an open-source license, hence the “Free” and “Lossless” terminology, but typically surpass common audio formats such as AAC and MP3 when it comes to sheer audio fidelity. Simply put, they sound better and require less space.  Because it's lossless, it is popular today.

Not like MP3 is nearly supported by all audio devices and multimedia players, FLAC is only supported by a handful of them. What's more, it usually cannot be played on your MP3 players. Thus, you need other ways to help you to convert Flac to MP3. Thankfully, there are <a href="https://gmagon.com/products/store/trytomp3/" target="_blank"> TryToMP3 </a> for you, if you favor convenience over audio quality.
