![](https://cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/windows-10-fall-creators-update.jpg)We've known that Microsoft planned to release a large [Windows 10 update](https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/11/windows-10-fall-creators-update/) this fall, but the company has been mum on the exact date. The Fall Creators Update is slated to feature some [big changes](https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/09/windows-10-preview-shows-big-changes-are-coming/), too, including [built-in AI](https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/28/microsoft-windows-fall-creators-update-security/) to fight malware, new Cortana features and handwriting recognition. While many expected bi-annual updates for Windows 10 starting in September, [_PC World_](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3221429/windows/windows-10-fall-creators-update-launch-date-leaked-by-lenovo-slips-to-october.html) reports that hardware partner [Lenovo](https://www.engadget.com/tag/lenovo/) leaked a Windows 10 ship date of October 17th on a since-deleted product page for its upcoming two-in-one PC, the [Miix 520](https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/31/lenovo-yoga-920-and-miix-520-at-ifa/).

Of course, this isn't an official date; we've reached out to Microsoft for comment on the matter, and will update this post when we hear back. Still, a fall release makes sense, given the name of the update itself.PC World's [Mark Hachman](http://www.pcworld.com/article/3221429/windows/windows-10-fall-creators-update-launch-date-leaked-by-lenovo-slips-to-october.html) thinks that Microsoft needs more time for its mixed reality technologies, but again, it's just speculation at this point.
