[Apple Watch Series 3](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/12/new-apple-watch-series-3/) is available with built-in cellular capabilities, allowing you to make phone calls, send and receive text messages, stream music, get directions with Apple Maps, use Siri, and more without a paired iPhone.

The freedom comes at a cost, however, as Apple Watch Series 3 models with cellular are priced $70 higher than those with Wi-Fi and GPS only. Also, to access LTE, the watch must be added to your phone bill as an additional monthly charge.

Here's a breakdown of how much [participating carriers](https://www.apple.com/watch/cellular/) plan to charge. Some carriers have yet to announce their plans.

waive its $30 activation fee, and is offering the first three months of service for free. The watch and iPhone share the same phone number via Verizon's NumberShare feature.

### AT&T
AT&T has [announced](http://about.att.com/newsroom/latest_apple_products_pricing_deals.html) that customers can add an Apple Watch to an eligible plan for $10 per month.

Sprint will also offer a special introductory three-month cellular plan trial. The carrier has yet to specify whether its activation fee of up to $30 per line will be waived as well, but it would seem likely.

### Bell \(Canada\)

Bell has [announced](http://www.bell.ca/Mobility/Cell_phone_plans/Smartwatch-data-plans/Overview.tab) that customers will be able to add an Apple Watch to an eligible plan for $5 per month. There is a one-time $10 activation fee. Bell will also offer a special introductory three-month cellular plan trial. The watch and iPhone share the same phone number via Bell's NumberShare feature.

Bell will not support the Apple Watch's cellular capabilities in Manitoba or Saskatchewan due to the carrier's

[lack of VoLTE](http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/carriers/bell/bell-numbershare-apple-watch-series-3-cellular/) in those provinces.

### EE \(UK\)

EE has [announced](https://twitter.com/DaveLeeBBC/status/907722508974956544) that customers can add an Apple Watch to an eligible SIM only or pay monthly plan for £5 per month, with the watch and iPhone sharing the same phone number. The carrier hasn't confirmed if it will be offering an introductory three-month trial, or if there will be an activation fee.

If you purchase your Apple Watch Series 3 directly through EE, the total monthly cost could [reportedly](https://www.cnet.com/uk/news/apple-watch-series-3-lte-could-cost-you-25-a-month/) be as high as £25, including unlimited data and the price of the watch. A tipster informed MacRumors that the unlimited data will only be for the first six months, with a limit of 10GB per month afterwards.

### Deutsche Telekom \(Germany\)

Deutsche Telekom has [announced](https://www.telekom.de/hilfe/geraete-zubehoer/handy-smartphone-tablet/apple/apple-watch-series-3?viewMode=faq) that customers can add an Apple Watch to an eligible plan for up to €4.95 per month, with the first six months free of charge.
