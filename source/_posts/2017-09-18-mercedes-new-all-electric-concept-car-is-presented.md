Mercedes-Benz is going all in on electric cars. 



On Monday, Daimler, the automaker's parent company, said that Mercedes will[sell electrified versions of all of its models by 2022](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-mercedes-benz-to-offer-electric-option-for-every-car-by-2022-2017-9). And on Tuesday, the company showcased an all-electric concept car, dubbed the Mercedes Concept EQA, that hints at what its future electric compact cars might look like. 

While the company didn't say whether the EQA would go into production, the company did make clear that the compact segment was important to it.

"The Mercedes-Benz Concept EQA proves that we are serious about introducing electric mobility throughout the portfolio," Dieter Zetsche, CEO of Daimler AG and head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, said in a statement.

And from the details Mercedes has shared about the Concept EQA, it looks like the carmaker is thinking about taking on Tesla's mass-marketModel 3. 

Here's a closer look at the EQA concept and how it stacks up against Tesla's newest vehicle.

Both the EQA and the Model 3 are compact vehicles that can fit five adults.

The wheelbase of the Model 3 is 113.2 inches, which is slightly longer than the EQA's wheelbase of 107.4 inches.

The Concept EQA has two electric motors and a range of about 400 kilometers, or about 250 miles per charge.

If Mercedes decides to build a production version of the EQA with the same range, it would beat out Tesla's base Model 3, which has a range of 220 miles per charge.

### The Concept EQA can be charged by plugging it in or via induction.

When using a rapid charging station, the car can get 62 miles of range in just 10 minutes, Mercedes claims. That's about one-fourth of a full charge.

Using Tesla's Supercharger, the Model 3 can get a range of about 110 miles in 20 minutes, or about 55 miles in 10 minutes.

### Mercedes claims it can go from 0 to 62 mph in under five seconds.

The base model of Tesla's Model 3 can go from 0 to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds, however, the upgraded Premium version can do the same in just 5.1 seconds.

### The vehicle features a panoramic glass roof and a large wrap-around rear window.

Tesla also offers a glass roof option with its Premium version of the Model 3.

Instead of a traditional radiator grille, the front of the vehicle has a black panel with LED strips. The panel serves as a virtual grille that can change in appearance, and the headlamps are also embedded in the black panel.

Tesla's Model 3 also does not have a traditional grille, but it's just a smooth surface.

The vehicle has two driving modes: Sport and Sport Plus. When the car is driven in Sport mode, the black panel shows a horizontal wing.
