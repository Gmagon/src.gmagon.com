## What are differences between XLS and XLSX?
![](img/xls-vs-xlsx.jpg)
XLS and XLSX are both file extensions that are used by the popular spreadsheet application named Microsoft Excel. Since 2003, XLS is very popular as it has been the default format for Microsoft Excel. Until the release of Microsoft Office 2007, it changed its default file format by adding an additional X in its document extensions-XLSX. Despite adopting and promoting the new XLSX format, newer versions of Excel are still able to open and save documents to the older XLS format.

## Why XLSX need to be exported to CSV?
By far, Microsoft Excel is the most popular spreadsheet application used to store tabular data. While this data is stored in Excel files (.xls or .xlsx), it is generally being exported to .cvs format (comma separated values) for transmission purposes. 

![](img/csv.png)CSV is an ideal format for the exchange of tabular data since it expresses it in form of textual data using delimiters, which are supported by various spreadsheet applications, or can easily be opened within simple text editors.
