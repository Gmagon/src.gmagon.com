## What is APNG?
APNG is an extension of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, adding support for animated images. It is intended to be a replacement for simple animated images that have traditionally used the GIF format, while adding support for 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. APNG is a simpler alternative to MNG, providing a spec suitable for the most common usage of animated images on the Internet.

APNG is backwards-compatible with PNG; any PNG decoder should be able to ignore the APNG-specific chunks and display a single image.

## What is GIF?
GIF files are commonly used on the internet, along with several other file formats such as JPGs and PNG. GIF is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format which uses a lossless data compression technique that reduces the file size without quality loss. A GIF can contain a maximum of 256 colors from the 24-bit RGB color space, which — although that may sound like a lot of colors — is actually a limited palette that makes the GIF useful in some scenarios but inappropriate to others.

The GIF was first developed by CompuServe in 1987 to and is widely used on the internet due to its portability and relatively small size, making GIFs available in any browser and on any platform, and fast to load.
