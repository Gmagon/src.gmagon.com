## What is APNG & GIF?
The APNG is also known as "animated PNG" which is made up of a series of PNG files of the same size that are connected as an animation. Though APNG tend to be smaller, but it support better quality images and transparency.

The full name of GIF is the Graphics Interchange Format. It is a bitmap image format that is widely used on the World Wide Web. GIFs are suitable for sharp-edged line art (such as logos, icons or avatars) with a limited number of colors. GIF’s advantages is that it is supported by practically all web browsers, can include transparent backgrounds, also supports interlacing (providing a low-resolution preview of the graphic to the viewer while it downloads), and can be used as an image map (allowing the viewer to click on the graphic as they would a regular link to another site).
