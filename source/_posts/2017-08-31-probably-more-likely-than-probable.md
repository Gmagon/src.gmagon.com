title: Probably More Likely Than Probable
---

What kind of probability are people talking about when they say something is "highly likely" or has "almost no chance"? The chart below,[created by Reddit user zonination](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/6vythg/i_redid_my_perceptions_of_probability_and_numbers/), visualizes the responses of 46 other Reddit users to "What probability would you assign to the phase: &lt;_phrase_&gt;" for various statements of probability. Each set of responses has been converted to a kernel destiny estimate and presented as ajoyplot using R.

Somewhat surprisingly, the results from the Redditors hew quite closely to a similar[study of 23 NATO intelligence officers in 2007](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art15.html). In that study, the officers — who were accustomed to reading intelligence reports with assertions of likelihood — were giving a similar task with the same descriptions of probability. The results, here presented as a dotplot, are quite similar.
