Got an idea for an app or program knocking around in your head but don’t know how to code? It’s often**hard to know where to start**, but for a short time, you can get started for**as little as $1**.

Tech Deals is currently hosting a**humble bundle-style**collection of[10 learning kits](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y). Pay whatever you want, and you can start learning everything from[JavaScript](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)to[Python](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)to[app programming](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y).

## What’s in the bundle:

* [Learn How to Code: Google’s Go Programming Language $249](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [The Complete Python Course: Beginner to Advanced $195](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [**Learn by Example: Scala $50**](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [Projects in Programming Languages: Ruby, Python, Java $150](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [**Learn Angular 2 from Beginner to Advanced $195**](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [How to Make a Freaking iPhone App: iOS 10 and Swift 3 $200](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [The Complete Web Developer Masterclass: Beginner to Advanced $195](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [Git Complete Mastery with GitHub: 100% Hands-on Git Guide $200](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [**Professional Rails Code Along $40**](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)
* [**JavaScript Programming Complete $99**](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y)

As is always the case with these kinds of bundles, paying less than the average won’t unlock the full set of kits. For this one, paying $1 will just unlock the[JavaScript walkthrough](https://goo.gl/uW1k6Y), which is**still a steal**since it**normally costs $99**.

Paying above the average unlocks**all 10 kits**, a total value of $1,573. At the time of writing, over 62,000 kits had been sold and the**average price was hovering around $15**. However, the nature of these kinds of bundles means that the average price will constantly rise as more and more users cash in.**So the sooner you pounce, the more you save.**
