Memes has been popular just  in recent years, but GIF is ancient in the Web, maybe older than you...

There has been a haunting question about GIF is how to pronounce it.

some say it it pronounced with a soft G, like "jiff." Others with a hard G, like "ghiff." 

Fortunately, most dictionaries accept both pronunciations as correct. So you can read it as what you want.



GIF has a rival, called APNG or animated PNG, "it is a high quality animated image format complete with full alpha channel and graceful degradation has been available and usable since 2004." The major advantage of APNG versus an animated GIF is image quality. APNGs simply look better, especially on a wider variety of backgrounds, and there's already support baked into both Firefox and Opera; Chrome users can [download an extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apng/ehkepjiconegkhpodgoaeamnpckdbblp?hl=en) to support APNG files.
