The specs for iPhone 8, which could turn out to be callediPhone X in the end, have been outed by aniOS 11 leak, and it'll speed thing up dramatically.

Apple's new iPhone will tout an A11 Fusion chip with a six-core processor, according to leaked iOS 11 Golden Master code dissected by [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/).

What does this mean? Importantly, it has four high-performance cores, which doubles the two power cores found in the four-coreiPhone 7 andiPhone 7 Plus.

The other two cores in six-coreiPhone 8 processor are high-efficiency cores. They're meant to run when your phone is idle. No need to waste iPhone 8 battery life if your phone is sitting idle on a table.

### Why iPhone 8 needs powerful specs

There's some good reason for the iPhone 8 to double its power cores: it's going to push Apple's smartphone series to new limits.

The iPhone 8 specs have to power 3D facing-scanning technology for Face ID, the biometric replacement for Touch ID fingerprint home button that'll be displaced by the all-screen display.

New camera needs also call for high-end specs. The iOS 11 leaked that the new iPhones will support 4K video at 60 FPS and 1080p video at 240 FPS.

The dual-lens camera Portrait Mode is also getting an upgrade with Portrait Lightning that supposed to use machine learning and depth sensing to give you options among professional-looking lighting conditions.

Finally, there's wireless charging, and the A11 Fusion include technical means to pull that off, a first for an iPhone. The question is, which features will the iPhone X get and which will be left to the two standardiPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus upgrades?

### More iPhone 8 specs questions

Doubling the iPhone 8 processor's high-end cores is good news, but it doesn't tell us everything about Apple's new handset's performance.

[How much faster will it be than the iPhone 1?](http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-x-will-this-be-the-new-name-for-the-iphone-8)

We still need to account for clock speed, RAM and graphics chip performance to determine if the A11 Fusion chip will be another 40% faster than the A10 Fusion chip \(like we saw from the jump from the A9 chip\).

Whatever number Apple touts, we fully expect the company to gleefully mention how much faster the iPhone 8 is vs the original iPhone 1 ten years ago. [iPhone 7 Plus vs the iPhone 1](http://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-1-vs-iphone-7-plus-this-is-how-far-weve-come-in-10-years) ended up being 120 times faster, so it'll be a bigger number than that.

We'll know the iPhone 8 release date, price and name on Tuesday, September 12, when Apple's live stream begins, and we'll be there reporting in person.
