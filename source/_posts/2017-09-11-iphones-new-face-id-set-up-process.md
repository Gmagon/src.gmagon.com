A Brazil-based iOS developer posted several screenshots and videos on Twitter not long after the initial leak, and the posts appear to show the process for setting up the iPhone's new Face IDauthentication. 

We get to see what appear to be the preference and settings screen for Face ID \(a name indicated by earlier leakson Saturday\), which allows you to select whether you'd like to use Face ID for iPhone Unlocking, Safari Autofill, the App Store, or iTunes.

And in the video, we also get to see what may be the Face ID authentication screen as it looks when you position your face in front of the camera for first time registration.

Of course, none of this is confirmed, but the demonstrations and settings screens, when paired with the leak information from Saturday, are pretty convincing.
