Make some room in your Lego budget, folks. They’ve just announced the latest round of Ideas approvals, and Lego is going to bring us that epic buildable Voltron set!

We got our first look at it back in May of last year, and it didn’t take long for designer Leandro Tayag to amass the 10,000 supporters he needed to get his creation in front of Lego’s reviewers.

It took the 41-year-old software designer  just three short weeks, no doubt partly due to the popularity of_Voltron: Legendary Defender_… but when an Ideas set looks this great and taps into 80s animation nostalgia, well, it’s going to attract a lot of attention. I remember how awesome I thought the die-cast version from the mid 80s looked when I was a kid, and I felt the same way all over again when I saw this one pop up on Ideas.

The images in our original post didn’t include a banana for scale, so here’s one of Leandro holding his fully-assembled, 2100-plus piece Voltron to give you some idea of how great it’ll look on display:

Now, as with all the announcements Lego makes about Ideas submissions[getting the green light](https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/caff4d5c-3394-434c-a852-85722a9bfeb9), it’s important to note that the finished product may not look exactly like what was pitched.

Let’s hope they don’t have to make too many tweaks to Leandro’s design to get this one on store shelves, because he really hit the ball out of the park. You’ll be able to find it early in 2018 in stores and on the Lego web shop in[the Ideas section](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Ideas-ByTheme).
