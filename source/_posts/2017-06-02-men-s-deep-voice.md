title: Men's Deep Voice
---

### **How do you  enjoy your spare time ?**

- Listening music; Reading books,
- Watching movies; Shopping,
- Drinking coffee with some of your friends or any thing else.

I have a strange hobby that I like be surrounded by voices when I am alone, by the way I am now with headphone in my ears intoxicated with Benedict Cumberbatch' s voice. I'm mad about his deep, low-pitched voice.

Hearing his low, husky voice,  it is charming and may have a gravitational attraction, I want to move closer to him. Imaging his evil & handsome face while holding a obstinate unruly smile. **Oh, I love it**

### **It is amazing that most of my girlfriends like men's deep voices.**

We love it, and just instantly find ourselves having a huge crush on men with deep voices. No idea how that happens, but it just does.

* The moment when the men enter a room and start talking. Just want to "beg" he to talk        more. we' re all ears.
* They sometimes come across intimidating, and in some cases that can be really attractive.
* Their voice speaks volumes about their confidence and powerful. Who doesnâ€™t like             confident men?

* Their voice also sounds comforting. They come across as someone who will protect us.
* Men with deep voices also somehow know how to take charge of the situation. And women do     love men who are good decision makers and can take control over situations.
* Lastly, they simply sound sexy All.

Haha , do you have the same feelings ? **Just enjoy...**
