Robert Noyce, who founded Intel in 1968, said, “Innovation is everything. When you’re on the forefront, you can see what the next innovation needs to be.” This is what inspires us every day at Intel.

This week at IFA Berlin 2017, we’ll see many new, innovative technologies and devices developed for the world of tomorrow on the show floor. It’s an exciting prospect. As technology evolves, it affects how we experience and interact with the world around us.

Intel is at the heart of creating these experiences as well as pushing the boundaries for what’s coming next. From processors to the entire platform, we’re fueling what the ecosystem can deliver to consumers – immersive experiences, portability, connectivity and more compute power in thinner, lighter, innovative form factors – that will set a new standard. One of the ways we do this is through strong collaboration with partners around the world, especially the makers of the PCs that we interact with every day and are an integral part of daily life.

On Aug. 21, Intel [introduced](https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/new-8th-gen-intel-core-processors-simplifying-today-opening-door-whats-next/) the 8thGeneration Intel® Core™ processor family and launched the first set of products – the mobile processors enabling thin and light laptops and 2 in 1 designs for consumers. With up to 40 perfect performance boost gen-over-gen1and double the performance compared with a 5-year-old machine2, these processors will deliver outstanding power, immersive entertainment, and a simple and convenient computing experience that people can feel.

The time has come when people have a PC on their own terms, and their devices adapt to their own needs. That’s the ultimate modern PC and the power of innovation. There truly hasn’t been a better time to get a new PC.
