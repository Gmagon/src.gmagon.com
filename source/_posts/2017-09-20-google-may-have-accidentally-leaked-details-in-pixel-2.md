Google may have accidentally let us in on some details about the Pixel 2 a little early.

Code buried within the Google app has revealed what appears to be a series of features slated for the Pixel 2, including the so-called "squeezable frame" and new ways to use the company's Assistant feature.

Some of the new details, which were [first reported](https://9to5google.com/2017/09/18/google-app-7-12-features-apk-teardown/) by _9to5Google_, aren't entirely new to those who have been paying attention to the Pixel 2 rumor mill, but the fact that signs of them were found in Google's own app makes the features much more likely to appear in the phone.

Among the most intriguing is a reference to a new gesture called “Squeeze for your Assistant.” Similar toHTC's U11, prior leaks have suggested the Pixel 2 will have a new shortcut triggered by squeezing the sides of the handset. This latest leak seems to confirm that gesture will be for invoking Google's Assistant.

Speaking of the Assistant,_9to5Google_also found references to new voices for Google's digital helper \(you'll now be able to choose male or female voices\), and the "possibility" of a new command to call up the Assistant in the first place. It's not clear whether this will be customizable or simply another addition to "Okay, Google," but it appears as if there may be new options.

Another interesting feature is something called "routines," which allow you to use a single command to trigger multiple actions at once. This could be particularly useful for home automation as you could give the Assistant one command i order to, say, turn your lights off and change your thermostat all at once.

Finally, the code also suggests Google will be adding new "sleep sounds" to help users fall asleep and new commands for controlling podcast playback. There are also references to a "Google Bar," though it's not clear exactly what that feature is \(likely a new shortcut for search.\)

Luckily, we won't have much longer to wait to find out the full details. Google is holding its Pixel 2 event October 4th.
