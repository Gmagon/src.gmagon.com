People wanting to fully utilize Apple Pay Cash in iOS 11 may have to scan a photo ID, such as a driver's license, according to the latest beta code discovery.

Lines in the [seventh iOS 11 beta](http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/08/21/apple-makes-seventh-developer-betas-of-macos-high-sierra-ios-11-tvos-11-available) reference scanning both the front and back of a card, _iHelp BR _[noted](https://ihelpbr.com/exclusivo-apple-pay-cash-pagamentos-via-imessage-no-ios-11-exigira-documentos-do-usuario/) on Friday. If an ID can't be verified, people may be blocked from using [person-to-person transfers](http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/06/08/apple-pay-person-to-person-transfers-will-be-free-with-debit-card-incur-3-fee-with-credit-card) in Messages, though any Cash balance should continue to work with other Apple Pay transactions.

The ID requirement may —primarily or in part —be linked to a minimum age barrier. The exact age limit is unknown, but Apple is presumably concerned about children abusing their parents' bank accounts and/or being lured into scams.

On a basic level, Apple Pay Cash gives users a PayPal-style holding fund, which can be applied to any kind of Apple Pay transaction. It's main purpose, however, is enabling iOS 11's person-to-person transfers. The finished version of iOS 11 is due sometime this fall, most likely next month ahead of the ["iPhone 8"](http://appleinsider.com/futures/iphone-8), ["7s"](http://appleinsider.com/futures/iphone-7s), and "7s Plus." 

In the beta code, Apple claims that Cash "works best" with a debit card. That may be a way of steering people away from credit cards, which will incur a [3 percent fee](http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/06/08/apple-pay-person-to-person-transfers-will-be-free-with-debit-card-incur-3-fee-with-credit-card) for person-to-person payments.
