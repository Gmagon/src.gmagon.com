Compared to your daily cup of coffee, your iPhone might seem like a big investment.

Buying a[cappuccino at Starbucks](http://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-order-how-you-spend-money-2017-6), for example, will run you about $3. That seems like nothing compared to the $699 starting price for the iPhone 8, or the iPhone X's $999 price tag. 

Unless, that is, you break the cost of your iPhone down by day.

In the US, the average smartphone owner keeps their phone for 22.7 months — about 690 days —before upgrading.

That makes the cost of the iPhone 8 a little more than $1 a day, after factoring in sales tax. Even if you upgrade every year using[Apple's iPhone upgrade program](http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-upgrade-program-2017-8), the daily cost is only a few cents more. 

And considering the typical cellphone user[touches his or her phone 2,617 a day](http://www.businessinsider.com/dscout-research-people-touch-cell-phones-2617-times-a-day-2016-7), the value you get for your phone almost certainly exceeds that of your cup of coffee. 

Other services you may use regularly, like your gym membership or streaming services, work out to less than a dollar per day. The mattress you sleep on may cost less than two quarters each night.

Puts thatdaily cup of coffee in perspective, doesn't it?

Still, most people[spend 70% of their budget](http://www.businessinsider.com/cutting-back-key-retiring-much-earlier-2017-7)on more expensive costs, like housing, transportation, and food. But cutting back in a few key areas could help you maximize the amount of money you're saving today. 

That's not to say that coffee has to go, but taking a different view of your spending habits can better inform the decisions you make.
