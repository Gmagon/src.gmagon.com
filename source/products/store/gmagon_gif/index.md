## USE CASES: BUILT FOR YOU
 Gmagon Gif aims to satisfy various requirements for different users. The full name of GIF is the Graphics Interchange Format. It is a bitmap image format that is widely used on the World Wide Web. GIFs are suitable for sharp-edged line art (such as logos) with a limited number of colors. However, rough edges are likely to appear when applying GIF files because it doesn't support alpha transparency like PNG does. Though both files are lossless, APNG is smaller and have better quality which supports more colors and transparency. More browsers support APNG now, particularly iOS Safari and Mac Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and Google chrome.

1. **Designers**: If a designer use GIF file in logo designing or else, he or she probably find that the GIF have rough edges and poor quality. It is far beyond what they supposed before. While APNG not only solve the rough edges problems, but also save much room for its smaller size. APNG is an obvious choice for designers who search for high quality and smaller size.
