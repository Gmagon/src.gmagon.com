What’s the difference between XLSX and CSV? 
A .xlsx is the typical file format for Excel, just as .docx for words. In a .xlsx you can save the formulas, graphs, pivots, etc in the file. Although Excel can read the fileformat and you can use formulas in it, you cannot save the formulas in the sheet. Excel will only save the result of the calculation.

In addition, XLSX does not allow you to store macros, as a security precaution. If you need macros in the file you have to use the XLSM file format.

A CSV is NOT a "spreadsheet" file format, but just a flat text file that uses a delimiter to separated the fields, e.g.
Header_1,Header_2
A,1
B,2

CSV is a simple, industry standard file format for exporting text only data from one system to be imported into another system. The importing system can be Excel or a "true database".

Where an Excel workbook can have more sheets, a CSV has only one sheet. When you open a .xlsx with a text editor you will see unreadable content, while a CSV is readable.
