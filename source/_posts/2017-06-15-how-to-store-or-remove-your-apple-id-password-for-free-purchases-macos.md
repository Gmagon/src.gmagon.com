title: 'How To Store Or Remove Your Apple ID Password For Free Purchases [macOS]'
---

The Mac App Store and the iTunes App Store both ask for your password when you download an app. You will be asked to enter your Apple ID password regardless if you’re buying an app or downloading a free one. This is done in part to prevent unauthorized purchases. It’s also a good deterrent for when the kids go wild on the App Store. The only problem is that it can get annoying. If you don’t want to enter your password for free app downloads, you can save it. Likewise, if you’re regretting this decision, you can remove your Apple ID password for free purchases. Here’s how you can store or remove your Apple ID password for free purchases in macOS.



### Store Apple ID Password For Free Purchases

There are two ways to go about this. One, open the Mac App Store app and look for a free app. Click the ‘Get’ button and enter your Apple ID password when prompted.

The Mac App Store app will prompt you to save your password for future free purchases. It’s very much like your browser asking to store login credentials for a website.

When you see the ‘Save Password for Free Items’ prompt, click ‘Yes’.

If the prompt doesn’t appear, you can use the second method.

Open the System Preferences app. Click the App Store preference. At the very bottom is an option called ‘Free Downloads’. Open the drop-down next to it and select ‘Save Password’. macOS might prompt you to enter your Apple ID password. This will not affect paid app downloads. You will still be asked to enter your password when you buy an app.

### Remove Apple ID Password For Free Purchases

Open System Preferences and select ‘App Store’. At the bottom of this preference pane open the Free Downloads drop-down. Select the ‘Require Password’ option. The next time you download a free app from the Mac App Store, you will have to enter you Apple ID password.

This option has its pros and cons. The pro here is that you don’t need to verify your identity when you download a free app. A free app, by and large, will not create a problem for you. The con is that even free apps can be problematic in terms of content. If you don’t want to save your Apple ID password for free apps to protect minors who might use your Mac, consider using parental controls instead of removing your Apple ID password.
