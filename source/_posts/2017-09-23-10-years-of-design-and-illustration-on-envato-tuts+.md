title: 10 Years of Design & Illustration on Envato Tuts+ 
---

There's a soft spot in my heart for nostalgic design. Like many creatives, I've grown up with the internet, and it's been fun to witness its growth and influence on traditional design and art mediums.

And since we're celebrating ten years of awesome tutorials on Envato Tuts+, let's walk down memory lane and look back on the last decade in design.

Where were you ten years ago?

## The Beginning of More Connection

### Years: 2007–2008

I remember how "social media" sounded like a foreign word back then. But soon, Facebook and Twitter showed us how much more connected we could be.

As we slowly grew out of the era of overloaded Myspace pages, social media sites reminded us that less is more. Apple's iPhone inspired designers worldwide with its clean aesthetics and advancements in mobile design.

A dramatic portrayal of NYC's advertisement firms in the 1960s, the TV show reinvigorated all our love for vintage design!

A familiar design website also emerged! Envato Tuts+ launched in 2007 with educational tutorials on freelancing and Photoshop. With a few simple steps, you could learn how to create cool metallic styles from the site's first instructors.

Because of the popularity of Flash at this time, design often featured bright colors and a focus on gradients. Here are a few of our very first tutorials!

## How Technology Changed Design

### Years: 2008–2009

Touchscreens made us one step closer to living like the Jetsons. Everyone wanted an iPhone to be connected to the future.

Smartphones made us care a lot more about the way we look, too. We studied the art of the perfect_selfie_and used advanced techniques to[post-process like a pro](http://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-your-iphone-like-a-pro-post-processing--cms-22741).

Apple continued to influence design trends as well. Fans recreated Steve Jobs's skeuomorphic aesthetics for icons and more. This meant that icon design mirrored the actual appearance of familiar, everyday items.

Many designers were undecided about the style but couldn't avoid its impact. It stayed a popular trend for quite a while before modern flat graphics took its spot.

Remember your first iPhone? Try out this awesome vector illustration from Nikola Adzic.

## The Rise of Flat Graphics

### Years: 2010–2011

Did we mention that less is more?

To compensate for the growing number of different devices, designers began focusing on responsive design. They began to question the future of web design as it applies to our individual user experiences.

## The Return to Minimalism

### Years: 2012–2013

It wasn't only that we wanted to see less clutter online; we also wanted less clutter in life.

The major trends of this time saw a return to simplistic aesthetics across several platforms. From fashion to graphic design, simplicity represented class and style.

Popular trends around lifestyle choices also affected how we designed at this time. Living healthier meant living simpler, with eco-friendly alternatives.

As with many things, trends have a way of lingering. During this time, flat graphics were embraced by everyone―from large brands to freelance designers.

## Photos, Videos, and 3D!

### Years: 2014–2015

I personally love howYouTube has changed things. Like many self-taught artists, I've spent hundreds of hours watching speed painting videos and more. Learning online is so essential these days for aspiring designers.

At this time, social media continued to change design too! The pursuit of followers and likes became a real part of online marketing tactics and forced a push towards picture perfect visuals.
