[Harbor](https://github.com/vmware/harbor) is an enterprise-class docker registry server to store and distribute container images. Follow this document to use Minio object storage server as a storage backend for Harbor container registry.

### Prerequisites

#### Install and run [Minio](https://github.com/minio/minio#docker-container) server 
```
docker run -p 9000:9000 --name minio \
-e "MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=minio" \
-e "MINIO_SECRET_KEY=minio123" \
-v /mnt/minio/export:/export \
-v /mnt/minio/config:/root/.minio \
minio/minio:RELEASE.2017-02-16T01-47-30Z server /export
```

#### Install Harbor registry 

The binary of the installer can be downloaded from the [release](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/releases) page. Follow [harbor installation and configuration guide](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/blob/master/docs/installation_guide.md) for further instructions.

### Edit '`config.yml'` 

Add the`s3`configuration to the storage section in your`common/templates/registry/config.yml`\(right below the cache configuration\). Here is a complete example[`config.yml`](https://github.com/harshavardhana/harbor-minio/blob/master/config.yml)for your reference.

```

regionendpoint: http://YOUR-MINIO-IP:9000
bucket: docker-registry

```
