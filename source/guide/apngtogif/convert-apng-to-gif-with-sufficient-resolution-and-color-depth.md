Many people intend to convert some animated PNG (APNG) images to animated GIF, and many of the questions asking how to create an animated gif from a set of png images in high quality. High quality not only means APNG with sufficient resolution and color depth.

To be able to convert animated PNG to GIF format on a Mac, you will need an APNG to GIF Converter for Mac. In this article, we will guide you through the process of converting APNG files to GIF format on Mac OS X. 

## What is APNG?
APNG is an extension of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, adding support for animated images. It is intended to be a replacement for simple animated images that have traditionally used the GIF format, while adding support for 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. APNG is a simpler alternative to MNG, providing a spec suitable for the most common usage of animated images on the Internet.

APNG is backwards-compatible with PNG; any PNG decoder should be able to ignore the APNG-specific chunks and display a single image.
