You may even be able to[send text messages with a connected tablet](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/send-receive-text-messages-android-tablet/). But there are some circumstances where the ability to send a text through a website comes in handy.

  , but you won’t have unlimited texts. If you ever run out, you can use one of these sites until your monthly text limit resets instead of paying per text.

In this case, a free text message service may collect inputted phone numbers to sell to third parties. Even if they aren’t collecting them right now, they could start at any moment,**so use these sites at your own risk**.
