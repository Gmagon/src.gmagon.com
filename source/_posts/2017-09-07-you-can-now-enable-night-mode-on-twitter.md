You're set after today... or rather, tonight. Twitter has [enabled](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/905477696360112129) night mode on the desktop web, giving your eyes a break when you just have to share your thoughts after dark. It's not automatic, alas, but the quick toggle \(it's in the drop-down settings menu\) means you can flick it on the moment the Sun goes down.

You didn't necessarily need this to have a night mode. Dedicated Twitter apps like TweetDeck for Mac already display in the dark. However, this makes sure that night mode is available to virtually everyone, regardless of what platform they use.
