 ### **Introduction**:
AMR, which stands for Adaptive Multi-Rate audio codec, is an audio compression format optimized for speech coding. AMR was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP in October 1999 and is now widely used in GSM[4] and UMTS. AMR speech codec consists of a multi-rate narrowband speech codec that encodes narrowband (200â€“3400 Hz) signals at variable bit rates ranging from 4.75 to 12.2 kbit/s with toll quality speech starting at 7.4 kbit/s. It uses link adaptation to select from one of eight different bit rates based on link conditions.
