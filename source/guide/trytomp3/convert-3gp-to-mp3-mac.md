### What is a 3GP file? 
.3gp and .3g2 are file extensions for video in 3GP format. This is a multimedia container format used by mobile phones. 3GP is a simplified version of the MP4 format and was designed to make file sizes smaller so mobile phones could support video.

There are two standards for this format: 3GPP, with the file extension .3gp, and 3GPP2, with the file extension .3g2. 3GPP and 3GPP2 stand for 3rd Generation Partnership Project and 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 respectively. These were separate collaboration agreements between several countries standardizing mobile phone formats. 3GPP files are for GSM based phones, 3GPP2 files are for CDMA based phones.

The 3GP file format can store video streams as either MPEG-4 Part 2, H.263 or MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC/H.264), and audio streams as AMR-NB, AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, AAC-LC, HE-AAC v1 or Enhanced aacPlus (HE-AAC v2).
