Google announced today that it's adding [Street View](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/05/google-street-view-camera-upgrade/) to the [Google Earth VR](https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/18/google-earth-vr-on-oculus-rift/) experience. With a new update, users can check out Street View images from 85 countries provided by the Street View team as well as pictures shared by others from around the world. To get there, while in Earth VR, zoom down closer to the street level and see if your controller says there's Street View imagery available. If so, you can then view the area within a 360 degree photo.

In a [blog post](https://www.blog.google/products/google-vr/get-closer-look-street-view-google-earth-vr/) today, Google suggested a couple of places to check out -- San Francisco's AT&T Park and the region of Croatia where_Game of Thrones'_King's Landing was filmed. The update is available today and users can experience it on [HTC Vive](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/07/la-noire-vr-playstation-4-xbox-one-switch/) and [Oculus Rift](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/08/oculus-pc-update-demo-mode/). Street View VR can also be viewed on a phone via the Street View app for Daydream and Cardboard.

_Correction_: An earlier version of this post said that users could experience Street View in Google Earth VR with Daydream and Cardboard, but only Street View VR can be viewed through those options.
