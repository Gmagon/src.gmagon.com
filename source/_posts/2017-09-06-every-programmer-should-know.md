A collection of \(mostly\) technical things every software developer should know.

☝️_These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack_

Highly opinionated💣. Not backed by science.
Comes in no particular order♻️

U like it?⭐️it and[share](https://twitter.com/mr_mig_by/status/900735231552098306)with a friendly developer! U don't like it?[Watch the doggo](https://twitter.com/RespectfulMemes/status/900147758845308930)🐶

_P.S. You_[_don't need to know_](https://xkcd.com/1050/)_all of that by heart to be a programmer.
But knowing the stuff will help you become better!💪_
