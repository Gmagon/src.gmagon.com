## Google has a new feature designed to help people suffering from depression.

Users in the United States who search for "depression" or "clinical depression" will now be offered a questionnaire to test their depression levels and help determine whether they should seek professional help, Google said in a blog post.

Users who search for information on depression will be shown a box at the top of their screen encouraging them to "check if you're clinically depressed." The clinically validated test, called PHQ-9, asks about energy, appetite and concentration levels, among other things.

The tech firm said it recognized that the information was "sensitive and private," and that it would not store the responses.

Google\([GOOGL](http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GOOGL&source=story_quote_link),[Tech30](http://money.cnn.com/technology/tech30/index.html?iid=EL)\)said the initiative was developed in partnership with the National Alliance on Mental Illness \(NAMI\).
