title: Crazy hardware presented at HAX’s 10th demo day
---

We stopped by [HAX’s](https://hax.co/) demo day at the San Francisco Mint to check out all the hardware startups in the accelerator’s 10th batch. Many of the startups showcased creative combinations of hardware and software, particularly machine learning, to improve upon legacy services and outdated business models.

HAX is known for its expertise in prototyping and manufacturing in China. The companies aided by HAX receive dedicated resources to address the unique challenges faced by hardware startup founders.

### Flow Neuroscience

Leveraging research in the field of neuroscience, the[Flow](http://flowneuroscience.com/wp/)team is creating a specialty wearable that uses targeted electrical impulses to treat depression. Studies have shown that activating the often subdued left frontal lobe can reduce symptoms of depression.

Users wear the headband for 25 minutes up to five times a week at first, gradually reducing their usage to a normal cadence. The goal is to help patients by reducing the need for antidepressant drugs.
