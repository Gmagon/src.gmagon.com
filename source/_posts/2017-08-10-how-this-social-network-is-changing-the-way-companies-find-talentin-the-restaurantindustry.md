When it comes to acquiring anew job in theservice industry, you may feel left out of the circle when you go to apply at different websites or businesses.

While there are many hiring platforms online, they seem to leave the service andhospitality industry out of the loop, and there you are, looking for your place only to find none.

As a culinary or service professional, you're not seeking to submit your resume in the same pool as a contractor or marketer. You want an intuitive tracking and monitoring system to allow you the best results \(and the best pay\) for the position you're looking for in any job.

This is where[Industry.co](http://industry.co/)steps in. Industry is a professional network, and hiring solution for the service and hospitality industry and they have single-handedly changed the way people in this niche stay connected to each other. If you're in this market, let me explain what Industry has done in connecting the service and hospitality industry together for life.

## Keeping It Tight

One of the reasons job seekers in this industry have a difficult time is the fact at how easy it is to get lost in the mix. There are plenty of job sites online where you can submit your resume. However, there is one major flaw with them.

Most are formatted for white collar job positions. While this is great for your CEO's and people who handle large quantities of businesses and brands in the form of clients, it's no good for a non-white collar worker who is looking for a great job.

You want potential businesses who are looking for your qualities and characteristics, and you can't get this if you're not woven inside a platform which connects you with like-minded people. This is the greatest value with someone of your skills in the hospitality industry. You could be a bartender, waiter, or chef, and having a network of other people in this genre can get you one step closer to your dream job.

If you want to catch a shark, you've got to go to the ocean, not my dad's backyard pond. The same principle applies here. Connect yourself to the businesses who need your services and skills which allow you to create valuable relationships to help you pursue your career even further.

## Keeping It Growing

According to[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2008/09/26/fastest-growing-industries-lead-careers-cx_tw_0926jobgrowth.html), the hospitality industry is one of the fastest growing industries right now. More and more people are working longer hours and taking on another job to make ends meet, and the service and hospitality industry is the perfect choice for many people.

This is one of the greatest attributes of how your professional life can change inside of a structured network. Not only do you have the opportunity to throw your paper resume away, but you also have the chance to grow your connections inside a platform built especially for you.

As you have probably already experienced, who you know has a big impact on the job opportunity you just applied for. In fact, you have a[2.6% - 6.6% higher chance](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-exactly-how-much-who-you-know-affects-your-chances-of-landing-a-job-2015-8)of getting hired simply because of who you know inside of the company.

Industry understands this and has given you the best chances possible to make an impact on the people around you who are working in the same field. This is not just a simple jobs board for the different brands. So we can truly help people and businesses and take this vertical to the next level. You should always be focused on growth and keeping company with a platform which promotes this growth on every level.

Growing your professional career and building relationships is the cornerstone of any successful business and job position. Staying connected to these people is the foundation you need to build a solid relationship with them in the future.

## Keeping It Simple

If you're in the market for a new job in the hospitality profession, one of the things you don't want to be doing is spending too much time hoping someone is going to hire you. Simplicity is important in any scenario of your professional life and while you already understand that discovering a great job is one of the perks of a job platform, can it still be easy?

What you want is a platform where you can market your skills and assets to potential businesses who are looking for them. In a sense, it's part social networking, connecting, and discovering jobs all rolled into one.

Considering time constraints and ease of use, you need something on the go where you can always stay connected and informed with your hospitality profile. The beauty of how they have upgraded this piece of the service profession is in their mobility to be where you are at all times.

Upload your credentials, resumes, and other important items your potential boss will be able to see and begin connecting with those like-minded people. That's how simple it can be.

If you're in the service and hospitality industry, you don't have to feel left out anymore. Nor do you have to haul around resumes and cover letters in your car to find a job perfect for your skillset.

You can market your skills and entice businesses to hire you by staying consistent, building relationships, and keeping up to date on all of the information and news within your industry. While you might think you've lost connection with jobs in the world of hospitality, you have the opportunity to build your career bigger and better than you thought you ever could with Industry.
