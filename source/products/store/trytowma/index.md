As a conceived competitor to the popular MP3, WMA enjoys its superiority. For WMA could produce files that were half the size of equivalent-quality MP3 files, it is also praised as "near CD-quality" audio. In short, WMA was intended to address perceived deficiencies in the MP3 standard. So users can use smaller WMA files to replace MP3 files.
