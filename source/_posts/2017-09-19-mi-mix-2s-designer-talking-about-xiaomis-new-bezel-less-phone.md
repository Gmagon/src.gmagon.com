#### Xiaomi Mi MIX Review – all screen, almost all of the time!

November 16, 2016

And now, Xiaomi is back again with another beautiful device. A common theme in the video is Jade, the ornamental rock that is heavily featured in Asian art. Xiaomi is using a unibody ceramic casing for the Mi MIX 2 to give it the cool, calm, quiet feeling akin to Jade. Last year’s Mi MIX featured a similar ceramic design, but the Mi MIX 2 improves on that design by featuring a full ceramic unibody casing.

One of the key points that Starck and Jun push in the video is_perfection_. Xiaomi took the time and effort to make what it thinks is the perfect device. According to them, it has the perfect body, a perfect aspect ratio, and removing something as small as a 0.1 mm seam makes all the difference. “It’s just magic.”

We recently spent some hands-on time with theXiaomi Mi MIX 2. We noted in our initial hands-on article that Xiaomi’s decision to shrink the size of the display and overall footprint made it easier to handle. Due to the smaller size, the phone lacks a headphone jack and the battery size drops from 4,400 mAh in last year’s Mi MIX to 3,400 mAh this year. Under the hood, the Mi MIX 2 has a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 or 8 GB of RAM, and 64, 128, or 256 GB of RAM.

What do you think of the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2? Do you think it lives up to the description from its famous designer? Are you going to consider buying one? Let us know down in the comments.
