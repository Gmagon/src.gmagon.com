### Inner-Shadow
You can apply shadows to the inside of a box through various settings of blur, offset, spread radius, color,.

1. **Blur radius**: The original value of the box is zero, the higher the number you set, the more blurred it will be, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter. The maximum value is one hundred.
