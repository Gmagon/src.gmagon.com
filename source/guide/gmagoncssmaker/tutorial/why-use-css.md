In previous page, we’ve learned that CSS is a style language that defines layout of HTML documents. In this article, we will delve in why we should use CSS instead of using HTML to code web page directly. 

CSS, or cascading style sheets, allows you to specify styles for the visual elements of your website. So what does this mean? It means that if we have a website element, let’s say a “title”, and we want to make the text size “20px”, the color “black”, and the padding around it “10px”, we would use CSS to control the look of our element. (See our article on <a href="./what-is-css.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" >What Is CSS? </a>for a more involved explanation of CSS.) 
## Why should we use CSS instead of HTML to code web pages? 
"Can't I just set all the visual elements of my web pages through my HTML code?" you may ask. And the answer is, yes, you can. CSS hasn't been around as long as HTML, and there are lots of perfectly good websites out there written exclusively in HTML code. But CSS does offer some distinct advantages in creating the "look" of your website.

**CSS saves you time**
In HTML, if you want all your H2 tags to appear in bold, for example, then you have to insert that font tag every time an H2 tag appears. For larger websites, this can be both tedious and time-consuming. But when you use CSS, you can set all element types (in this case, H2 tags) to appear in whatever style you want (such as bold). No matter how many H2 tags your web pages have, the CSS will set the style for all of them at once.

**CSS saves your visitors time**
The key to a user-friendly website is a speedy load time, right? Since you're using less code in CSS than you would be in HTML (remember, you only have to set the style for each unique element one time), your pages will load faster for users.

**CSS gives you design flexibility**
If you'd like certain types of web pages to have unique stylistic elements, you can create a separate CSS file for each type of page. Your customer service pages can look completely different from your "about us" pages, for example. And CSS offers more stylistic possibilities than HTML does, so you have more visual options at your disposal. So even if you're not the fastest coder in the West, you can still give your website a complex, professional look.

These are just a few reasons why we choose to use CSS. Although we have not gone into the details of using CSS (that is well beyond the scope of this article), we hope that you have a better understanding of why CSS is important.
