  files;

In our professional lives, stuff happens like [this man](https://www.hackread.com/man-accidentally-destroyed-production-database-on-first-day-of-his-job/) who a few months ago accidentally destroyed production database on the first day of his job or this engineer from Amazon whose [minor typo](https://www.hackread.com/typo-took-down-amazon-internet-network/) brought the entire Internet Network of Amazon down.

In a similar incident, a software developer recently claimed that he accidentally and permanently deleted three months of his work because of Visual Studio Code.

[Visual Studio Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code)is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring

In a now deleted post \([cache available here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170818080940/http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?d=1462716999241&mkt=de-DE&setlang=en-US&w=xEsMxqoa0KJSwMsTh3p_8w2qryykfDvB)\), the developer Eliecer Thoms from Panama wrote that: “I had just downloaded Visual Studio Code as an alternative, and I was just playing with the source control option, seeing how it wanted to stage five thousand files I clicked discard… And it deleted all my files, all of them, permanently

How the f\*\*\* is this s\*\*\* possible, who the hell is the dumbf\*\*k who made the option to permanently delete all the files on a project by accident even possible?? Cannot even find them in the recycle bin!!!! I didn’t even think that was possible on windows!!! F\*\*\* this f\*\*\* editor and f\*\*\* whoever implemented this option. I wish you the worst.”

Then there were 14 lines cussing the Visual Studio Code developers.

However, in reply, one developer asked: “Why you have three months of work not under source control is the bigger question.” In reply, the Thoms said: “Yeah, so the damage done by the destructive bug in the code is now my fault for not being a clairvoyant and seeing this piece of shit software was going to fuck up my files.



I don’t need to explain why I don’t have a private repo with my stuff. It is the software’s concern NOT to destroy the integrity of a computer like a damn virus. You come here, see my despair and berate me for something that was not my fault, and has happened to a lot of other people? F\*\*\* you.”

The post was originally identified by Joshtops on [Slashdot](https://it.slashdot.org/story/17/08/18/1626219/developer-accidentally-deletes-three-month-of-work-with-visual-studio-code). However, it is unclear if the developer was able to get his data back or not. That’s why [offsite backups](https://www.hackread.com/how-to-prevent-issue-of-encryption-based-malware-ransomware/)and revision control is a very good idea.

If you play with such a massive trove of data always backup your files and make sure – never keep a single copy of your files in one system.
