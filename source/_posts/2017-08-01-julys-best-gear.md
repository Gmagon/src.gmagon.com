## Leica TL2

How do you turn a smartphone-photo devotee into a bona fide camera nerd? Give them smartphone-style touchscreen controls on an excellent camera. The new Leica TL2 does just that. The camera is spec’d through the roof; the mirrorless system camera comes with a 24-megapixel sensor, a battery of native T-type lenses, plus adaptors for screwing on other Leica system lenses. Even better, a smartphone app connects your phone to the camera and lets you download and share your shots over Wi-Fi. If you buy a TL2, your Instagram game is going to get bonkers.[Read the full story here](https://www.wired.com/story/leica-tl2/).

## Master & Dynamic MA770

You know Master & Dynamic for its ultra-luxe headphones. The newest addition to the company lineup, the MA770, is a 35-pound speaker made of concrete \(yes, cement and crushed rocks\) that is equal parts art and audio. It looks looks like brutalist architecture sculpted in a wind tunnel by an origami artist. The sound quality isn’t overshadowed by the aesthetic, though—the MA770 has legit hi-fi chops. Just don’t plan on toting it from room to room. There are anvils lighter than this.Read the review here.

## Specialized Turbo Vado 6.0

Think of the Turbo Vado 6.0 as the love child of a shrunken Vespa and an overweight 1967 Schwinn Typhoon. The waterproof alloy frame has a gently sloping step-through top tube, making it easy to wear a skirt while riding. A removable 604-watt-hour battery pack seamlessly integrates into the down tube, and the belt-driven 350-watt motor sits hidden in the bottom bracket. After a full charge that takes 4 hours and 20 minutes, the bike is ready to roll. Choose between three modes—Eco, Sport, and Turbo—for varying levels of power. Riding uphill in Eco mode can be a killer quad workout, but flip to Turbo mode and it becomes a Mary Poppins joyride.Read the review here.

## Lenovo X1 Yoga Gen 2

The X1 Yoga combines the bendy 360-degree hinge design of the Yoga line with the high-end performance and feature set of Lenovo’s venerable X1 Carbon laptop line. With this update, Lenovo stuffs in a few extra upgraded parts: Two Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports offer rapid charging and “anti-fry protection,” and the power adapter can now charge the machine 80 percent in just 60 minutes. At 3.1 pounds, the X1 Yoga is a bit beefy but still quite usable. On the other hand, the price tag, at $1,709, is decidedly hard to swallow.[Read the full review here](https://www.wired.com/2017/07/review-lenovo-x1-yoga-gen-2/).

## Barista Brain Nine Cup Coffee Maker

The OXO works the same way electric coffee makers have worked for decades, but does everything more precisely than grandma’s old Mr Coffee. The hot water travels out of the reservoir and rains on the grounds in scheduled intervals, including an initial pour specifically designed to create a bloom, similar to the pour-over method used by baristas at fancy coffee shops. Pair it with the Conical Burr Coffee Grinder With Integrated Scale and you’ve got a damn good cup of coffee.Read the review here.

## Google Photo Books

Google Photo Books takes all of the hassle out of creating a thoughtful keepsake. Just sort through your sky-high digital photo pile using Google’s AI search chops, pick 20 photos you want to feature \(or add more for additional cost\), order them however you like, slap a name on the front, and it’ll be on your doorstep in two weeks. A 20-page softcover costs you $10 with 35-cents per extra page, while hardcover runs $20, with extras comping in at 65-cents a shot. You get a little more than you pay for, but remember that you’re not paying much.Read the review here.

## Meizu Pro 7

Listen, we know you’re addicted to your smartphone. Meizu has an unorthodox solution to this screen addiction: add another screen, this time to the back of the phone. The Pro 7 comes with a 2-inch rectangular touchscreen across the back left side of the phone, which displays things like the weather, messages, email, fitness activity, and alarms. It also serves as a handy viewfinder for snapping selfies with the outward facing camera. The idea? Making information glance-able will ultimately lead to less dependence on our gadgets. Maybe.Read the story here.

## HP Spectre X2

The 2017 Spectre x2 is foremost a tablet by design. The keyboard is magnetically attached and pulls off easily should you want to lighten the 2.4-pound load by three-quarters of a pound. Battery life has been improved by 15 percent over last year’s model, and the screen is even brighter than before. On most tests, it even outperformed many high-end laptops. Crow about the Surface Pro all you want: Today the Spectre x2 is the 2-in-1 to beat.Read the review here.

## Humanscale

During the 70s and 80s, designers relied on an analog tool to help them design products for humans. This tool, called Humanscale, was a set of nine rotating disks filled with more than 60,000 data points. Spin the selector in any direction and a series of numbers align in the windows to show you the correct measurement values for the subject you happened to be designing for—things like average height, arm span, sitting hip width, and viewing angle from a desk. MIT Press stopped printing the disks in the mid 1980s, but now, a team is reviving the classic design tool with reprints selling for $79 each or $199 for the complete set.Read the story here.

## OpenROV Trident Underwater Drone

Using a tablet, smartphone, or laptop as a controller, you can send OpenROV’s underwater drone as deep as 328 feet, to zip around at a top speed of 4.6 mph and record video in 1080p. The Trident is tethered, but that lifeline leading up to the surface is necessary, since radio waves don’t play well in water—plus, if the drone runs out of juice, you can just reel it in. It’s time to finally answer that nagging question: “Do you think there’s a body down there?”Read the story here.

## Nike Fe/Nom

Nike’s newest sports bra, the Fe/Nom, consists of two pieces of fabric stitched together. The secret? It’s made from Flyknit, the material best known for Nike’s kicks. The bra includes six different weaving zones; the tightest stitch is reserved for the underband, which carries most of the load, while the back uses a more open stitch to create greater flexibility and ventilation. A knit fabric might seem like an unlikely material to keep that damage at bay, but Flyknit offers a surprising amount of support—and not in the I’ve-strapped-duct-tape-to-my-chest kind of way.Read the story here.

## Stromer ST1 X

Perhaps you dream of being an S-pedelic commuter: sleeping late, zipping to the office, and arriving with time to spare, your freshly pressed Thomas Pink unsullied by pit stains. If so, get a Stromer e-bike. Like many fashionable e-bike brands, Stromer is not for bargain hunters—but its newest addition, the ST1 X, is almost as good as the flagship and far more affordable. The ST1 X boasts top shelf e-bike features like regenerative braking, a large lithium-ion battery, and a purpose built 6061 aluminum frame. Plus, it’s smart! The bike’s performance is tuned using a proprietary algorithm, which can be customized. Stromer can ping it to apply free firmware updates on the fly.[Read the full review here](https://www.wired.com/2017/07/review-stromer-st1-x/).

## Hestan Cue

Even home chefs could use more precision in the kitchen. Look no further than the Cue, a 1600-watt induction burner that looks like a miniaturized Roomba. A custom 11-inch fry pan with temperature sensors in the base and a tiny circuit board in the handle sits on top. The pan-and-burner combo pair to an app, which provides step-by-step guidance through tested recipes. Want that steak rare? Just tell the app, and it’ll help you nail the internal temperature while browning the outside just right.Read the review here.

## Mighty

Mighty works like an iPod Shuffle, but for Spotify. Choose a few Spotify playlists to sync onto the device \(Mighty can hold about 1,000 songs\) and then you are free to roam the planet to the soundtrack of your choosing, freed from the shackle of your phone. Use it while working out, walking the dog, or driving, and you’ll find you can flip through music with fewer distractions and more tactile controls. It’s not perfect, but Mighty’s definitely on to something here. Plus, this won’t be the last Spotify-powered gadget you’ll see in the coming years.Read the story here.

## Volta V Gaming PC

Many stories have been written about the Volta and its impressive woodiness. Less has been written about how well it actually works. And considering this gaming computer comes with a price tag approaching $3,500, it better work pretty well. Fortunately, the components are dazzlingly high-end with blistering performance across the board. Gamers will find the platform ideal for their needs, while style mavens will find the machine runs Facebook just as well as anything else.Read the review here.
