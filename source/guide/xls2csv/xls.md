## What is an XLS file?
XLS files are a spreadsheet file created by Microsoft Excel or another spreadsheet program, such as OpenOffice Calc or Apple Numbers. It stores data in worksheets, charts, and macros.   

An XLS spreadsheet is used for organizing, analyzing, manipulating, and visualizing data. The spreadsheet commonly consists of a table with rows and columns. The table cells in the file may contain manually entered data or the results computed from the data of other cells.
