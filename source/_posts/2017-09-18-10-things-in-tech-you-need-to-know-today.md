Good morning! Here is the tech news you need to know this Monday.

Facebook handed over information about the ads, which were linked to a Russian troll farm, and how they were targeted at US users.

2.[A Republican lawmaker, Dana Rohrabacher, tried to make a deal with the White House on behalf of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-congressman-sought-trump-deal-on-wikileaks-russia-1505509918?tesla=y). Assange, currently in hiding in the UK, would theoretically offer detailed evidence that Russia had not meddled in the US election, in exchange for "something like" a pardon.

Rovio has had a tough few years financially, and that valuation is lower than expected.

5.[Facebook, Google, and Twitter all allowed advertisers to target users with racist and anti-Semitic terms, according to numerous media reports](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters). Facebook allowed marketers to target "Jew haters",[Twitter let people target users](http://www.thedailybeast.com/twitter-lets-you-target-millions-of-users-who-may-like-the-n-word)who used the "N" word, and[Google allowed the phrase](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/google-allowed-advertisers-to-target-jewish-parasite-black?utm_term=.jvrArLM5e#.beQp9n6MN)"black people ruin everything" — all three firms subsequently updated the categories on their ad platforms.

8.[Google's Chrome will crack down on autoplay video ads, and will only play them if the user has shown interest in the clip, or if they don't play with sound](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16311310/google-chrome-autoplay-videos-january). There'll also be the option to mute entire sites.

9.[Workplace chat service Slack has been valued at $5.1 billion \(£3.7 billion\) after closing a $250 million \(£184 million\) funding round led by SoftBank's Vision Fund](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-17/slack-gets-slice-of-softbank-s-100-billion-tech-bounty).
