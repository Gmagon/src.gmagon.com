Apple released iOS 11, its next-generation mobile operating system a few days back, which includes hundreds of new and hidden features for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.

So we wanted to know how is your iPhone’s battery life after installing the iOS 11 update?

Some of our readers have[complained that their iPhone’s battery is draining more quickly](http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/09/ios-11-bugs.html)after installing iOS 11 update but it doesn’t seem to be widespread.

The problem with battery life issues is that it is very subjective as it is based on your usage pattern, so it is difficult to pinpoint what exactly is causing a problem. So for example, if you’re checking out the exciting new ARKit apps then there is a possibility that your iPhone’s battery is draining more quickly as camera usage can have an impact on battery life.
