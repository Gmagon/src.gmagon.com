title: Intel delays 10nm CPU tech for the third time 
---

Intel has been reacting to AMD for most of the year, but now their plans for 2018 just went into disarray as the once champion of the industry has hit yet another roadblock of its next-gen 10nm CPU node.

Intel's upcoming Cannon Lake CPU architecture has been delayed, for a third time, to the end of 2018. Cannon Lake was once pitched as a mid-2017 release, and is now 18 months behind. Digitimes is reporting that Intel's delay of Cannon Lake is hurting OEM partners, who are thinking of skipping Cannon Lake for Ice Lake, which is reportedly coming out very close to the release of Cannon Lake.

This gives Intel's competitors in the semiconductor business with a chance to dash up to, and ahead of Intel. We have TSMC, Samsung and Globalfoundries \(a close partner of AMD\) who all expect to have 10nm or better nodes online by 2019, which now won't be too far away from Intel.
