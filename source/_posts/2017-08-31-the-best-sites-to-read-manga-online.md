title: The Best Sites to Read Manga Online
---

Manga is a Japanese style of comic books that has proven to be a big hit around the world. But it’s difficult to distinguish official English translations from fan-made translations. For that, you need to know the right sites to read manga online.

For a long time, manga comics weren’t officially translated into English, nor available digitally. This led to the rise of “scanlations,” the original Japanese comics were scanned, and then fans translated them in the speech bubbles.

Things have changed for the better since then. There are some[excellent apps to read comics](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-apps-reading-comics-ipad/)[The Best Apps for Reading Comics on Your iPad](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-apps-reading-comics-ipad/)[The Best Apps for Reading Comics on Your iPad](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-apps-reading-comics-ipad/)There are many reasons to buy an iPad, but few are as nerdy as the pursuit of a digital comic book reader.[Read More](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-apps-reading-comics-ipad/). And you don’t need to rely on these unofficial sites and scanlations either. Here are the best ways to read manga online. All entirely legal.

Kadokawa is among the biggest manga publishers in Japan. Fed up with the scanlations, the company launched its own official service to read comics online for free. Yup, completely free.

Not all of Kadokawa’s popular titles are available here, but many are. You can actually use the app without signing up, although registering adds some cool features like creating a library of favorites, and getting notifications when a new issue is published.

ComicWalker is notable for its no-nonsense, no-strings-attached approach. This is the place to go if all you want to do is read manga without any hassles. And since it works from the browser, you can read it from your office too.

## How Do You Read Manga Online?

These five sites are the best places to read manga online today. But it’s worth considering how you want to consume your favorite books. Manga is generally black and white, so you don’t need a color screen to get the most out of the artform. This makes the Kindle an ideal device, but the low storage may prove to be a problem. Thankfully, the[iPad is an excellent way to read manga](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/your-ipad-the-best-way-to-enjoy-manga/)[Your iPad: The Best Way To Enjoy Manga](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/your-ipad-the-best-way-to-enjoy-manga/)[Your iPad: The Best Way To Enjoy Manga](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/your-ipad-the-best-way-to-enjoy-manga/)Having been brought up on western comic books, it's refreshing to be introduced to a wholly different comic book culture.
