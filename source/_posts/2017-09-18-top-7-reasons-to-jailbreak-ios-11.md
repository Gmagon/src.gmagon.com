With every new iteration of iOS, the operating system is getting more polished and feature-rich, which makesjailbreaking less exciting. But there are still many reasons to jailbreak iOS 11. In this article, we will go through the some of the reasons why we want a jailbreak for iOS 11.

### 1. Activator:

Activator is an awesome jailbreak tweak by Ryan Petrich that you probably already know about. For those who’re new tojailbreaking, Activator lets you assign various actions that get called when a certain event, selected by you, occurs. The trigger can be a gesture, a tap on a specific area, the press of a button, a change of charging state or a bunch of other options. The “actions” list is equally diverse, letting you launch apps, toggle settings and is extensible via tweaks on Cydia.

### 2. App Enhancements

One of the best reasons of having a jailbreak is adding new functionality to stock and third-party apps and getting rid of the restrictions imposed. In the case of SnapChat, you can install jailbreak tweaks like Phantom to bypass the restrictions in the app.

Messages Customiser as the name suggests lets you customize almost every aspect of the Messages app such as change the color of the message bubbles, enable Contact photos and lots more.

The Cydia store is filled with lots of tweaks to enhance your experience using stock and third-party apps ranging from tweaks for Instagram that allow you to save photos and videos to your device to hacks for Snapchat that would allow you to view snaps as long as you want and save them to your Camera Roll.

### 3. iFile

iOS 11 comes with an all-new Files app, which offers functionality closer to Finder on the Mac. However, it is still not as powerful as iFile, as it still won’t give you access to the system files. Considering the closed ecosystem of iOS, it doesn’t come as a surprise. But with the help of jailbreak, you can get access to the file system.

iFile is a complete file manager tweak that allows you to view system files and folders as well as edit them right from your iPhone. You can also save files that you download from the internet.

### 5. Prevent access to apps and folders

When your iPhone falls into the wrong hands, there are chances that your private information will be viewed without your permission. Thanks to awesome jailbreak tweaks in Cydia such asAsphelia, BioLockdown& BioProtect, you can lock apps and folders on your device with Touch ID or passcode and prevent unauthorized people from accessing them.

### 7. Set Default apps

One of the major limitations of iOS is the lack of an option to set your favorite third-party app as the default app. Thankfully jailbreak tweaks like MapsOpener, allow you to set Google Maps as the default app instead of Apple’s Maps app andBrowserChooserallow you to change the default browser.

These are some of the reasons why we want to jailbreak iOS 11. How about you? Are you waiting for the jailbreak to upgrade to iOS 11 or you will upgrade to iOS 11 when it is released on September 19?
