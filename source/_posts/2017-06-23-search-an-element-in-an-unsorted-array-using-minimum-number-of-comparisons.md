title: Search an element in an unsorted array using minimum number of comparisons
---

Given an array of **n **distinct integers and an element **x**. Search the element **x **in the array using minimum number of comparisons. Any sort of comparison will contribute 1 to the count of comparisons. For example, the condition used to terminate a loop, will also contribute 1 to the count of comparisons each time it gets executed. Expressions like **while \(n\) {nâ€“;} **also contribute to the count of comparisons as value of **n **is being compared internally so as to decide whether or not to terminate the loop.

Examples:

```
Input :
 arr[] = {
4
, 
6
, 
1
, 
5
, 
8
}, 
        x = 
1
Output :
 Found


Input :
 arr[] = {
10
, 
3
, 
12
, 
7
, 
2
, 
11
, 
9
}, 
        x = 
15
Output :
 Not Found
```

## [Recommended: Please try your approach on**{IDE}**first, before moving on to the solution.](http://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/)

Below simple method to search requires**2n + 1**comparisons in worst case.

```
for
 (i = 
0
; i 
<
 n; i++)  
// Worst case n+1
if
 (arr[i] == x)  
// Worst case n
return
 i;
```

How to reduce number of comparisons?

The idea is to copy x \(element to be searched\) to last location so that one last comparison when x is not present in arr\[\] is saved.

**Algorithm:**

```
search(arr, n, x)

if
 arr[n
-1
] == x  
// 1 comparison
return
"true"

    backup = arr[n
-1
]
    arr[n
-1
] = x


for
 i=
0
, i++ 
// no termination condition
if
 arr[i] == x 
// execute at most n times
// that is at-most n comparisons

            arr[n
-1
] = backup

return
 (i 
<
 n
-1
) 
// 1 comparison
```

```
// C++ implementation to search an element in
// the unsorted array using minimum number of
// comparisons
#
include
<
bits/stdc++.h

using
namespace
std
;


// function to search an element in
// minimum number of comparisons
string
search
(
int
 arr[], 
int
 n, 
int
 x)
{

// 1st comparison
if
 (arr[n
-1
] == x)

return
"Found"
;


int
 backup = arr[n
-1
];
    arr[n
-1
] = x;


// no termination condition and thus
// no comparison
for
 (
int
 i = 
0
; ;i++)
    {

// this would be executed at-most n times
// and therefore at-most n comparisons
if
 (arr[i] == x)
        {

// replace arr[n-1] with its actual element
// as in original 'arr[]'

            arr[n
-1
] = backup;


// if 'x' is found before the '(n-1)th'
// index, then it is present in the array
// final comparison
if
 (i 
<
 n
-1
)

return
"Found"
;


// else not present in the array
return
"Not Found"
;
        }
    }
}


// Driver program to test above
int
main
()
{

int
 arr[] = {
4
, 
6
, 
1
, 
5
, 
8
};

int
 n = 
sizeof
(arr) / 
sizeof
(arr[
0
]);

int
 x = 
1
;

cout
<
<
 search(arr, n, x);

return
0
;
}
```

Output:

```
Found
```

Time Complexity: O\(n\)

Number of Comparisons: atmost**\(n+2\)**comparisons
