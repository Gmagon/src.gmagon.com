The world is getting smaller thanks to technology, media, more convenient travel, and — let's be honest — Netflix. It's becoming more valuable than ever to learn a second, third, or fourth language—and it's also easier than ever thanks to all of the above.

[uTalk Language Education](https://shop.mashable.com/sales/utalk-lifetime-subscription-1-language?utm_campaign=utalk-lifetime-subscription-1-language&utm_content=a0x1a000000y8XK&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=mashable.com&utm_term=scsf-248987&utm_xpath=learn-new-language-with-utalk-app&utm_xpos=main)is one shining example of the merits of technology when it comes to going bilingual. You'll learn practical vocabulary—meaning no more rote memorization of pizza toppings and animal species like you had to do in high school Spanish or French class. Instead, you'll be learning concrete, applicable knowledge that you can directly use to converse with native speakers in real-world situations. Using recordings of native voice artists, the program teaches you how native speakers actually talk, so you're not listening to a robot with strange intonation and inflection.

The program keeps the learning interactive by verifying your progress with speaking games. You'll be able to measure your achievements as you go through the program, so you'll know what areas are your strengths and what you need to improve on. And for extra convenience, you can use whatever device you want to run the uTalk program. Just access your account and you'll be able to pick up right where you left off.

uTalk offers more than 130 languages to choose from, so once you've mastered one language, you can learn another. For a limited time, you can get a lifetime subscription to uTalk Language Education in one language for only$19.99. That's 69 percent off the regular price of $64.99.
