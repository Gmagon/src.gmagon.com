Right now, the retailer offers both the Fire Stick and Fire TV, but it looks like it’ll get a few new siblings with some newly leaked devices. According to_AFTVnews_, we’ll see two new streaming devices soon — a mid-tier Fire TV device and a top-tier set-top box.

The new mid-tier device will be an HDMI dongle that looks a lot like the [Chromecast](http://www.androidauthority.com/chromecast-apps-for-android-417028/). It’ll plug directly into the HDMI port of your TV and will come with support for 4K HDR video at 60 FPS. Under the hood, the device will sport a 1.5 GHz quad-core processor, Mali 450 GPU, 2 GB of RAM, 8 GB of storage like other Fire TV devices. The quad-core processor and upgraded GPU will make it a more powerful device than the current [second-gen Fire Stick](http://www.androidauthority.com/new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-39-99-alexa-voice-remote-718882/). Instead of replacing the second-gen Fire Stick however, the new dongle looks to live alongside it and offer customers a choice between a more budget-friendly option that can stream at 1080p and a more powerful device that can support 4K and HDR.

The second device is a cube-shaped set-top box that integrates far-field microphones and an IR transmitter. This device will also output 4K HDR at 60 FPS and will also include [Alexa](http://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-echo-commands-alexa-737189/) integration and the ability to control other devices in your home. On top of the box, sit volume and mute buttons as well as an action button to trigger the assistant. The familiar blue LED light bar will also be present. Using the microphones built into the cube or the voice-enabled remote, you’ll be able to trigger Alexa whenever you want and get a response either through your television speakers or the cube’s built-in speakers.

The power of the new set-top box could be in its ability to control other devices around it. It’ll have the ability to turn on any HDMI-CEC-enabled television it’s connected to. Plus, with the inclusion of an IR transmitter, it’ll also be able to control devices like televisions, A/V equipment, air conditioners, and more. This is a clear decision to take the fight to Google after the release of the [Google Home](http://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-review-720059/).

Prices have yet to be revealed, though we expect to see the dongle announced this month and released the next. Details are less clear for the top-tier cube, but we think it’s safe to say that it will see the light of day before the holiday season.
