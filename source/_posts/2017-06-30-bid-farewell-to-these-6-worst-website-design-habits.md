You can get rid of heavy designs like carousels, too many pictures, videos, etc., which slow down the loading process. Make sure you put only the most essential content on your page above the fold. Your user will not mind scrolling over to the next page but aslow loading page will definitely make you lose out on visitors.

## Non Responsive Design

As more and more people are shifting to hand held mobile devices to access the internet, it is almost a crime to not make your website mobile responsive. Lack of responsiveness will not only make your website difficult to view on a smaller device like a tablet or a mobile phone, it will also push down your ratings on the Google search, which can be disastrous for any website.
