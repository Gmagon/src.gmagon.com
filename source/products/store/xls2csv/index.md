## USE CASES: BUILT FOR YOU
 XLS is an MS Excel workbook binary file, which holds information about all the worksheets in a workbook, and can also hold additionals like charts, images, etc. XLS files can only be read by applications that have been especially written to read their format, and can only be written in the same way. Pre-2007 versions of Excel use XLS as the primary format for saving files. It features calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language called Visual Basic for Applications. It has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms 

A CSV is a comma separated values file which allows data to be saved in a table structured format. CSV files can be used with any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, Open Office Calc, or Google Spreadsheets. They differ from other spreadsheet file types in that you can only have a single sheet in a file, they can not save cell, column, or row styling, and can not save formulas. In ecommerce, CSVs are used primarily for importing and exporting product, customer, and order information to and from your store:

1. **Importing and Exporting Products**: Importing your products is the fastest way to create or update products in bulk.
