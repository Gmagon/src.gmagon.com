## How to design buttons with CSS on Mac? 
Step1: Open and run the <a href="https://gmagon.com/products/store/gmagon_css_maker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gmagon CSS Maker</a>, you can choose the background of your button as you wish by clicking the "Viewport" stylesheet, so that you can decide width and height, and color of background.

Step2: Choose "Basic" information to change the width and height of the original content to make it suitable for the shape of a button. Besides, opacity is also for users to adjust.

4. **Saturate**: Saturate effect makes the image look more vivid. It’s a cool effect that can make photos look like posters or cartoons. The value of amount defines the proportion of the conversion. A value of 100% leaves the input unchanged. Other values are linear multipliers on the effect. This effect makes images look pretty funky.

4. **Huerotate**: By shifting the colors around, Huerotate exerts much interesting results. If you can imagine a color spectrum going from red to violet around a color wheel, then this effect takes the original color on the wheel as input and rotates it by the angle parameter to produce the color on the wheel to which it rotated as the output color value.

4. **Brightness**: It just like brightness control in your computer screen. It adjusts the colors between completely black and the original color in proportion to the amount parameter.

4. **Contrast**: This effect will adjust the difference between the darkest and lightest parts of the input image. If you use 0% you end up with black just like with ‘brightness’, if you hit 100%, it is the original image again.

4. **Invert**: If you applied 100%, the output looks like a photo negative back from the old film days of cameras. Using values smaller than 100% will progressively apply the invert effect.

4. **Opacity**: This filter can help your content looks semi-transparent. The 100% value is completely opaque, the output will be exactly the same as the original content. If the value is below 100%, the output image will become less opaque. While 0% means the content will totally invisible.
