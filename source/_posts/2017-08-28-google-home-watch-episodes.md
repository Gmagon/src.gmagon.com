title: Google Home lets you watch the latest CBS and CW episodes
---

With [Google Home](http://www.androidauthority.com/?q=google+home&q-submit=Submit) already [allowing voice control](http://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-services-749968/) for your Spotify and Netflix accounts, it was only a matter of time until more services were allowed to use Google’s connected speaker to act as a pseudo-remote. That inevitability continues to become reality as you can now use Google Home to watch shows from CBS and the CW through CBS All Access and CWTV, respectively.![](http://cdn01.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Google-Home-Review-10-of-15-840x474.jpg)Google confirmed the news with Engadget, though the search giant clarified that the new updates are rolling out “as they get ready.” In other words, not everyone will see CBS All Access and CWTV as options in the Google Home application, though that should change relatively soon.

The good news is you do not need a subscription to CBS All Access to stream episodes, though the amount of content you can watch will be limited and you will be “treated” to ads during episodes. Even so, this is exciting news for those who wanted to use Google Home to control video services apart from Netflix and YouTube.

Weirdly enough, it seems as if support for CWTV is very limited, with folks only able to play the latest aired episode and not able to issue next or previous episode commands. You also cannot turn dubbing on or off and play the next unplayed episode, though this all could change with an update.

If you want to link your CBS All Access and the CW subscriptions, you will first need to open the Google Home app. From there, go to the Videos and Photos section and link your accounts. You will need to sign in to each service to complete the process, and you can choose to unlink the apps at any time.

Keep in mind that more video services, such as Hulu and HBO Now, will [eventually include Google Home support](http://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-getting-new-fun-features-coming-countries-772882/). We’re still scratching our heads over why [YouTube TV](http://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-tv-review-762562/) is not yet supported, though.
