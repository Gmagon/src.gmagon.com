### What is XLSX? 
XLSX files are the default spreadsheet output documents of newer versions of Microsoft Excel, starting with Microsoft Office 2007. These XLSX files can also be opened with older versions of Microsoft Excel, though compatibility support must first be downloaded from the Microsoft website and installed in the system. Integrated with XML specifications, these XLSX files can be implemented into certain Web publishing applications and database programs. The data stored in an XLSX file usually consists of text, numerical data and stats that are entered by a user, and certain functions for automating mathematical calculations or text formatting options may also be implemented into an XLSX spreadsheet. These .xlsx documents are also integrated with compatibility support for VB scripting through macros. With a new GUI (Graphical User Interface) that comes bundled with these newer versions of Microsoft Excel, users can access the integrated features of this data management and spreadsheet software with ease, allowing them to create suitable document presentation materials.
