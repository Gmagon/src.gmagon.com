[Outlook 2016 for Mac](https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/02/outlook-2016-for-mac-now-supports-google-calendar-and-contacts/)users are about to get a big update with some of the[most requested features](https://blogs.office.com/2017/06/19/outlook-2016-for-mac-is-adding-your-most-requested-features/)for the venerable Microsoft email program. You can now send your emails when you want with a new Send Later feature, use delivery and read receipts to make sure your emails are received and even create calendar events and tasks from your emails. You can also save your oft-repeated emails as templates to make sending them much faster, and Microsoft has simplified the account setup process.

The Send Later function is hidden under the little down arrow by the Send Email button and will be available to Office Insider Fast members now and Office 365 subscribers in July. All other new features should be ready for Office 365 subscribers right away, including the easier onboarding process, which automatically detects your email settings from your address so you don't have to, and read receipts, which may be the bane of our existence, but seem to make business users pretty happy.
