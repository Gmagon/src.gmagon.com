If you still listen to audio through your computer’s built-in speakers, this deal’s for you. It’s a[small, USB-powered sound bar designed just for computers](https://www.amazon.com/EIVOTOR-Powered-Soundbar-Speaker-Computer/dp/B06Y3SYTMC?kinja_price=34&tag=kinjadeals-20&ascsubtag=[t|link[p|1818486039[a|B06Y3SYTMC[au|5727177402741770316[b|deals)\(though I could also see using it with, like, a bedroom TV\). Just plug in the USB port for power and the 3.5mm jack for audio, and boom: Instant audio upgrade. Today’s deal is about $6 less than usual on this model, and an all-time low.

Now, rather than traveling with a wall charger, a battery pack, and a microUSB cable to recharge said battery, all I need is the Fusion and my Apple charging cables.

[SONOS PLAY:1](http://ebay.to/2y3Ygeq)

, $165

We’ve seen bigger SONOS PLAY:1 deals before, but generally speaking, discounts of any size are few and far between. The[PLAY:1](http://ebay.to/2y3Ygeq)is the smallest member of the SONOS family, but[it still sounds fantastic](http://gizmodo.com/sonos-play-1-review-easy-great-sounding-wireless-musi-1444794711#_ga=2.145077617.43561166.1505050928-1420257556.1504286530), and you can even link two of them together as a stereo pair.

Even if you have a car charger you’re happy with already, I like keeping a spare in my luggage for rental cars.

### Top Home Deals

[Insta-Bed Never Flat Queen Air Mattress with Pillow Top Cover](https://www.amazon.com/Insta-Bed-Raised-Mattress-Never-Flat/dp/B006OU4F4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&tag=kinjadeals-20&ascsubtag=[t|link[p|1818486039[a|B006OU4F4M[au|5727177402741770316[b|deals)

Nobody relishes the idea of sleeping on an air mattress, but they might not mind this[discounted Insta-Bed](https://www.amazon.com/Insta-Bed-Raised-Mattress-Never-Flat/dp/B006OU4F4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1&tag=kinjadeals-20&ascsubtag=[t|link[p|1818486039[a|B006OU4F4M[au|5727177402741770316[b|deals).

$100 is more than you’d spend on most other air mattresses \(though it’s an all-time low for this one\), but this one includes a pillow top cover for extra softness, and most importantly, a built-in pump that silently trickles more air into the mattress overnight. Just set your desired firmness, and the mattress will automatically maintain it as long as it’s plugged in. I slept on one of these for a few days after a recent move, and loved it as much as anyone can love sleeping on an air mattress.

If you’ve ever been to a fancy cocktail bar, you’ve probably noticed drinks served with giant spheres of ice.

Yes, there are molds out there that make more spheres at once, but most of them create considerably smaller spheres. Plus, the Tovolo is Amazon’s \#1 seller, sports a 4.6 star review average, and can stack in your freezer to take up less space. Cheers!
