** Headphones in my ears with a beautiful song Hero… **

*I enjoy the melody and the lyrics:* 

*“There’s a hero, if you look inside your heart,* 

*you don’t have to be afraid of what you are.*

*There’s an answer. If you reach into your soul.*

*And the sorrow that you know, will melt away…"*

** I once saw a saying in a blog “you may not fancy a certain singer, but you must like listening music, because some melodies or lyrics show things for the occasion you like, or both of the two.” **

I enjoy wearing my headphone and listening music in my sad or happy time. Even when I am running, walking, reading, or sleeping in bed, I indulge myself in a musical world and cannot take my headphone off. Do you have a moment that a lot of memories appear in your mind, you just want to spend time with your favorite music.

** Everyone has a dream, and has been working hard to realize this dream. **

After graduation from my university, I left my hometown to a strange city in the first time, and lived in unfamiliar environment, because I just wanted to achieve career success. While facing the pressure of work, I only wanted to go home, even gave up. ** On such occasion, I always took out my tiny Walk Man, put headphones in my ears and enjoyed my favorite song-Hero by Mariah Carey. ** The song always has the magic power that helps me go through troubled water. Finally, I insisted on the work, and witnessed my growth.

The Hero is a powerful song that can go into your heart, even go into your soul, you can get the answer, all the doubts are gone, a strong hero will stand out. With no fear, I believe that I can insist. When I feel with no hope, get into my deep heart, be strong, be powerful. Finally, you will find you are the hero.

** We all know that it is very difficult in the process of realizing a dream, but no one can crush your own dream, don’t give up, tomorrow you will find your way. **

I have special emotion to all the songs in my Sony Walk Man. Hero is just one of them.

When I am sad, play the happy songs, when I am thinking, play the soft ones, ** just enjoy… **
