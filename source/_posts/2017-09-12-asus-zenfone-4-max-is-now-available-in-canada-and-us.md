![](http://cdn01.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Asus-ZenFone-4-Max-Plus-Charging.jpg)Last month, ASUS announced its brand new [ZenFone 4 family](http://www.androidauthority.com/asus-zenfone-4-series-specs-price-release-date-794086/), and today we’re getting an idea of when we can actually get our hands on them. The lineup includes the ZenFone 4, ZenFone 4 Pro, ZenFone 4 Max 5.2″, and, ZenFone 4 Max 5.5″. As of today, you’ll be able to pick up the ZenFone 4 Max 5.5″ from a number of outlets, but you’ll have to wait on the rest — ASUS says that they should all trickle out in Q4 2017.

The ZenFone 4 Max 5.5″ is headlined by a 5.5″ IPS LCD display with 2.5D curved glass and an aluminum-alloy body. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor, 3 GB of RAM, and 32 GB of storage. ASUS claims that the ZenFone 4 Max 5.5″ will get up to an amazing 46 days of 4G standby time. The low-power processor and gigantic 5,000 mAh battery combine with ASUS’ PowerMaster technology to promise “a full working day and beyond” of battery life.

ASUS has jumped on the dual-camera bandwagon, too. The ZenFone 4 Max 5.5″ features a dual 13 MP setup with one main camera and one 120-degree wide-angle camera. It joins the [LG G6](http://www.androidauthority.com/lg-g6-review-752130/) as one of the only phones on the market with a true wide-angle lens. The phone also features phase detection autofocus that ASUS claims will acquire focus in 0.03 seconds, even in poor lighting conditions.
The ZenFone 4 Max is available for purchase from the [ASUS Store](http://fave.co/2xt11Ki), [Amazon](http://tyvm.ly/ZigXZV), [Best Buy](http://fave.co/2gWRaoN), [B&H](http://fave.co/2xsh4rA), [Newegg](http://fave.co/2gZJPor), or [Abt](http://fave.co/2gXj5VU) for $199 in the US or $299 in Canada. We’ll keep our eyes peeled for release dates of the rest of the ZenFone 4 lineup and bring you updates when they become available.
