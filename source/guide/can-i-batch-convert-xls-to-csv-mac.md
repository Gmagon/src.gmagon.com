Are you looking for a way to quickly and easy convert a directory of .csv files into the .xls or .xlsx format? While in your Mac system, it is unable for you to install an Excel as Windows does. Besides, you cannot batch convert your XLS batch files in Excel. If you need to manipulate XLS, XLSX, or CSV file data, <a href="https://gmagon.com/products/store/xls2csv/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" >XLS2csv</a> converter comes in with many bells and whistles and special processes including:
* It is 10-20 times faster than using Excel.
* It also allows for the saving and restoring of complex 'conversion jobs'.
* It is able to move or delete files after processing, and skip files already processed
* The results can be previewed before conversion starts.
* You can import and convert files in batch.
