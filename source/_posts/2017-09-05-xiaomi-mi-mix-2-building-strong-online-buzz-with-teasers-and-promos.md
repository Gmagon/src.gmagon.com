Can Xiaomi rain on Apple’s parade by[unveiling its “full screen 2.0” flagship mobile device](http://pocketnow.com/2017/08/30/xiaomi-mi-mix-2-september-11-announcement-beijing-official)the day before[the most highly anticipated iPhone release in history](http://pocketnow.com/2017/08/31/apple-event-now-set-for-september-12-at-steve-jobs-theater)? Obviously not, but all signs seem to point to theMi MIX 2 launching in higher numbers andlooking even better than its[remarkably eye-catching predecessor](http://pocketnow.com/2017/01/08/xiaomi-mi-mix-hands-on-video-ces).

According to the Chinese company’s very active CEO on local social media of late, “mass production” is already underway. There was nothingmass-oriented aboutthe original Mi MIX, mind you, so we have every reason to expect significantly lesslimited availability this time around.

The second-generation“concept”is also the protagonist of a fairly aggressive marketing campaign, building strong online buzz with various teasers and promos focused largely on its barely visible bezels.

Last year’s obtrusive “chin” has been reduced to a minimum, as you can notice in a series of images outlining the new phone’s general shape and contour. It’s definitely possible the Xiaomi Mi MIX 2 will[break the 90 percent screen-to-body ratio barrier](http://pocketnow.com/2017/03/06/xiaomi-mi-mix-2-magic-number-93), packing a Snapdragon 835 processor for top-shelf raw speed, as confirmed by Qualcomm’s own official Weibo account.

[That’s clearly no big surprise](http://pocketnow.com/2017/07/06/xiaomi-mi-mix-2-possible-benchmark-specs-snapdragon-835), since we’re dealing with an ultra-high-end handset through and through, although some may have hoped to see the SD836 debut inside the Mi MIX 2.[The honor should go to Google after all](http://pocketnow.com/2017/08/24/google-pixel-2-pixel-xl-2-october-5-announcement-rumor), and just to generate a little extra excitement, Lei Jun has a few pics to share of the fancy retail box you’ll get his company’s next hero device shipped in… if you’re lucky.
