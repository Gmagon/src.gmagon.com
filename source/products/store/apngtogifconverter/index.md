## USE CASES: BUILT FOR YOU
 The full name of GIF is the Graphics Interchange Format. It is a bitmap image format that is widely used on the World Wide Web. GIFs are suitable for sharp-edged line art (such as logos) with a limited number of colors. This takes advantage of the format's lossless compression, which favors flat areas of uniform color with well defined edges. Though APNG tend to be smaller, and better quality (more colors, and the ability for transparency), unfortunately it is largely unsupported. GIF's advantages is that it is supported by practically all web browsers, can include transparent backgrounds, also supports interlacing (providing a low-resolution preview of the graphic to the viewer while it downloads), and can be used as an image map (allowing the viewer to click on the graphic as they would a regular link to another site). You definately need this convenient software if you are:


1. **Webmasters and Designers**: As well as small file sizes, GIFs also support transparent backgrounds and therefore can help show a professional look to a website with an animation over a different background. Besides, they have relatively small file sizes; this means that they can be used easily online as they can load quicker and still have a good quality.
