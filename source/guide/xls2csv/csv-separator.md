This article aims to explain how to separate Excel files with delimiters in CSV files. It provides a fast detection of a character separated text file, and returns it ready to use in a CSV parser. This may be useful to the vulnerable -and often ignored- population of programmers who need to process automatically CSV files from different sources.
