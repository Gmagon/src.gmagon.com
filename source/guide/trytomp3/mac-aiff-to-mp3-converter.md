### What is AIFF? 
AIFF is short for Audio Interchange File Format, which is an audio format initially created by Apple Computer for storing and transmitting high-quality sampled audio data. It supports a variety of bit resolutions, sample rates, and channels of audio. This format is quite popular upon Apple platforms, and is commonly adopted in professional programs that handle digital audio waveforms.

AIFF files are uncompressed, making the files quite large compared to the ubiquitous MP3 format. AIFF files are comparable to Microsoft's wave files, because they are high quality they are excellent for burning to CD. There is also a compressed variant of AIFF known as AIFF-C or AIFC, with various defined compression codecs. Though AIFF files are popular among Macintosh users and audio professionals, PC users tend to use wave files instead.

The file extension for the standard AIFF format is .aiff or .aif. For the compressed variants it is supposed to be .aifc, but .aiff or .aif are accepted as well by audio applications supporting the format.
