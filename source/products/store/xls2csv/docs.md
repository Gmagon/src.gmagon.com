### **Introduction**: 
XLS is the default file format for the 2003 version of Excel and older while XLSX for versions since 2007. XLS is based on BIFF (Binary Interchange File Format) and as such, the information is directly stored to a binary format. On the other hand, XLSX is based on the Office Open XML format, a file format that was derived from XML. The information in an XLSX file is stored in a text file that uses XML to define all its parameters.

CSV files hold plain text as a series of values (cells) separated by commas (,) in a series of lines (rows). You can actually open a CSV file in a text editor and read it yourself. Many applications are capable of reading CSV files, and many languages provide built-in functions that simplify reading/writing CSV format.

XLS2csv is a file converter which tends to convert XLS/XLSX files to CSV format. With it installed, you can not only do file conversion but also join our community and get our excellent after-sale services. No annoying ads, bundled software and plug-ins will be added onto your Mac.
