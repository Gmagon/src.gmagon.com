While announcing its[$1.1 billion deal with Google](http://www.phonearena.com/news/Google-pays-HTC-1.1-billion-for-certain-employees-and-a-non-exclusive-IP-license_id98260)today \(under which certain HTC employees are joining the Mountain View giant\),HTC also confirmed that it's working on its "next flagship phone." The company didn't provide any details on this handset, but we may have some information on it anyway.

According to French website Frandroid \(usually a reliable source\), HTC plans to announce a high-end smartphone in November. Reportedly, the device is called U11 Plus, and will become HTC's first handset to sport a near-bezel-less screen - a 5.99-inch display with 1440 x 2880 pixels and an 18:9 aspect ratio. This means that the U11 Plus could be about the same size as LG's V30, which has a similar screen.

Apart from offering a large near-bezel-less display, the HTC U11 Plus may not be too different from the already available HTC U11\(pictured above\). It's said that the new handset is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor, with 4 GB / 6 GB of RAM and 64 GB / 128 GB of storage space. The U11 Plus should be dust- and water-resistant \(IP68\), further offering a 12 MP rear camera, an 8 MP front-facing camera, and HTC'sEdge Sense feature.

Frandroid has it that the HTC U11 Plus will be officially unveiled on November 11, possibly alongside a lower-endHTC U11 Life. Both new handsets should be released in China first, but they'll likely be available globally at some point.

We're obviously curious to see what HTC's first near-bezel-less smartphone looks like. What about you?
