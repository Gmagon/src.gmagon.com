## [Import A Photo Edited On Your iPhone To Your Mac](http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-import-an-edited-photo-from-your-iphone-to-your-computer/)

It’s not so great when you want to move the edited version of the photo to your desktop. You just can’t copy the edited version and will always have the original photo. Here’s how to circumvent that.
