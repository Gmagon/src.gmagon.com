Comma Separated Values (CSV) is a text file format that you can use to exchange data from a database or a spreadsheet between applications. Each line in a Text CSV file represents a record in the database, or a row in a spreadsheet. Each field in a database record or cell in a spreadsheet row is usually separated by a comma. However, you can use other characters to delimit a field, such as a tabulator character, a semicolon character or a full stop character.
