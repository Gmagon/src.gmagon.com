## What is Excel?
Excel is an Electronic Spreadsheet Program. It is a computer software program from Microsoft that is part of the Microsoft Office suite of software programs. I was first released on September 30, 1985, and developed by Microsoft. Indeed, the personal computing renaissance of the 1980s and 1990s was largely driven by the many uses of Excel and other spreadsheet software. Excel is capable of Creating and editing spreadsheets that are saved with a .xls or .xlsx file extension. 

The electronic spreadsheet is a computer software program that is used for storing, organizing and manipulating data. It was originally based on paper spreadsheets used for accounting. As such, the basic layout of computerized spreadsheets is the same as the paper ones. Related data is stored in tables - which are a collection of small rectangular boxes or cells organized into rows and columns.

Current versions of Excel and other spreadsheet programs can store multiple spreadsheet pages in a single computer file.

As you can see, the document is comprised of columns and rows. A cell lies at the intersection of each row and column that numbers or text can be entered.

The address of any given cell is generated by combining the letter of the cell's column with the number of the cell's row. As the image above, the cell highlighted in the diagram is at address B4.  

There are more complex spreadsheets that can contains hundreds or even thousands of rows and columns,  the combination of which can represent millions of cells. These cells can be linked together with calculations and formulas to perform complex mathematical logic simply and easily.
