title: Top 50 Sketch plugins
---

Sketch has taken the design market by storm. They don’t release any official numbers, but it’s pretty obvious that almost any design team you join or talk to knows about or uses Sketch to some extent.

One of the most powerful aspects of Sketch is its lively developer community and the fantastic set of plugins they’ve built for it. With Sketch plugins, you can create gorgeous 3D illustrations and unique animations in seconds.

I gathered a list of fifty of the best Sketch plugins to save you time on research. I organized them by categories below.

## Sketch Plugin Managers 

You should start by installing one these four Sketch plugins. They will help you manage and run your plugins efficiently.

### Sketch Packs

A Sketch plugin browser, manager, and auto updater. Sketch Packs will also save you from unexpected compatibility issues while updating Sketch by locking plugin versions.

### Sketch Runner

### Sketch Plugin Manager

This is the third of four plugins you will find handy when it comes to testing and managing your plugins. It uses Git to manage all of your plugins and keeps them up to date.

### Sketch Toolbox

Sketch Toolbox is another option that helps you manage, install, and update all of your Sketch plugins.

While you should try all these four plugins, my favorite one is Sketch Runner – it gives you much more than just plugin management. If you get used to it, you won’t be able to imagine using Sketch without it.
