## What is M2TS
M2TS is a filename extension used for the BDAV MPEG-2 Transport Stream container file format, for multiplexing audio, video and other streams.

## MTS vs M2TS
MTS and M2TS are both file extensions for AVCHD, that is the HD digital video camera recorder format, and they both support 720p and 1080i HD video formats. They all play in great quality in 1080i direct on the PC or to a Sony TV using composite video or HDMI. MTS and M2TS files are all forms of MPEGs, Ted.

According to Wikipedia, they are slightly distinguishing. HD cameras record .mts but export as .m2ts. While the file extension of AVCHD video is MTS, if imported to computer, it will become M2TS. MTS is the format not collected by specific software, and will change into the video file with M2TS as the file extension after collection.
