>**How can I convert big MOV files to MP3 format on MacBook Pro?**
>“Hi, guys, I have some big .mov video files on my MacBook Pro that I would like to convert them from .mov to .mp3 as any other songs I have on iTunes. I dragged them to iTunes and I tried to convert them to mp3 but iTunes just keep giving me an error message so I guess iTunes has issues handling big MOV files. A bit annoying. How can I do it? If someone can give me a better idea to do it quickly, I would be deeply thankful. Thanks in advance.”
